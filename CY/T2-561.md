# Applied Cybersecurity — Exam 2 Comprehensive Study Guide

## 1. Cryptography & Encryption

### Core Concepts

- **Encryption:** Converts readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a key.
- **Decryption:** Converts ciphertext back into plaintext.
- **Hashing:** One-way transformation of data into a fixed-length string.  
  - Used for integrity verification (e.g., passwords, file checksums).  
  - **Cannot be reversed** (unlike encryption).

#### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography

| Feature | Symmetric | Asymmetric |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Keys | Single shared key | Public key + private key |
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Use Case | Encrypting large data quickly | Secure key exchange, digital signatures |
| Example | AES, DES, RC4 | RSA, ECC |

- **Symmetric:** Both sender and receiver share the same key.
- **Asymmetric:** Uses a pair — one public (shared) and one private (kept secret).

#### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys.
- Enables **authentication**, **confidentiality**, **non-repudiation**, and **integrity**.

### Ciphers & Historical Cryptography

- **Vigenère Cipher:** A substitution cipher using a keyword to shift letters by variable amounts.  
  Example: Key = “KEY” → Shift pattern K=10, E=4, Y=24.
- **Transpositional Cipher:** Rearranges letters (changes order but not the letters).
- **Substitution Cipher:** Replaces letters (e.g., Caesar cipher).
- **Code:** Substitutes entire words or phrases, not individual letters.
- **Enigma Machine:** WWII electromechanical rotor device for polyalphabetic substitution encryption.

---

### Hash Functions

- **Hash Function:** Algorithm that generates a fixed-size hash (digest) from any input.  
  - Example algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
  - Used in password storage and integrity verification.
  - Sensitive to small input changes (avalanche effect).

## 2. Network Security & Architecture

### Network Infrastructure

- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** A separate network segment that isolates public-facing servers (like web or email) from internal networks.

- **DDoS (Distributed DoS):** Same concept, but attack originates from multiple sources (botnets).

---

### Application & Database Attacks

---

## 5. Malware & Malicious Code

- **Virus:** Requires user action to spread (e.g., opening infected file).

- **Malware Goals:** Disrupt, damage, steal, or spy on data/systems.

---

## 6. Authentication & Access Control

- **Type II Error:** False accept (impostor allowed).
- **FRR (False Rejection Rate):** Rate of Type I errors.
- **FAR (False Acceptance Rate):** Rate of Type II errors.
