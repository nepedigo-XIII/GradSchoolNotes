## Cryptography and Data Protection

### Hashing vs. Encryption

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hashing** | A one-way mathematical process that converts input data into a fixed-length hash value or digest. Used primarily for **data integrity verification**, not confidentiality. |
| **Encryption** | A two-way process that uses a **key** to convert plaintext into ciphertext and another key (or the same, depending on algorithm) to decrypt it back into plaintext. Used for **data confidentiality**. |

**Key Points:**
- Hashing is *irreversible*. Encryption is *reversible* with the right key.
- Example of hashing: verifying downloaded files or storing passwords.
- Example of encryption: securing email communications or file storage.

---

### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Algorithms

| Feature | Symmetric Encryption | Asymmetric Encryption |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Keys Used** | One key (same for encryption and decryption) | Two keys (public key + private key) |
| **Speed** | Faster | Slower |
| **Use Case** | Encrypting bulk data (e.g., disk encryption) | Key exchange, digital signatures |
| **Examples** | AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish | RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman |

**Why use one vs. the other?**
- **Symmetric** algorithms are preferred for speed and efficiency in encrypting large volumes of data.
- **Asymmetric** algorithms are ideal for securely exchanging symmetric keys or verifying identity.

---

### Vigenère Cipher

- A **classical polyalphabetic substitution cipher** that uses a keyword to shift letters.
- Example: if keyword is "KEY", the cipher repeats this keyword across the plaintext.
- Each letter of the keyword determines the shift for the corresponding plaintext letter.

**Formulas:**
- Encryption:  
  \[
  C_i = (P_i + K_i) \mod 26
  \]
- Decryption:  
  \[
  P_i = (C_i - K_i) \mod 26
  \]

---

### Transpositional vs. Substitutionary Ciphers vs. Code

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Transpositional Cipher** | Rearranges the position of letters in the plaintext without altering the actual letters. | Columnar Transposition Cipher |
| **Substitutionary Cipher** | Replaces each letter with another letter or symbol. | Caesar Cipher |
| **Code** | Replaces entire words or phrases with other words or symbols. | “Bluebird” = Secret Operation Name |

---

### Enigma Machine

- Used by Germany during WWII for encrypting communications.
- Operated through a system of **rotors and plugboards** that applied multiple layers of substitution.
- Its complexity made brute-force attacks nearly impossible until the Allies broke it.
- Demonstrates early **mechanical encryption** and **key management** principles.

## Backup and Recovery Concepts

### Full, Differential, and Incremental Backups

| Type | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|--------------|------|------|
| **Full Backup** | Copies all data each time. | Simplifies restoration. | Time and storage intensive. |
| **Differential Backup** | Backs up data changed since the last full backup. | Quicker restores than incremental. | Grows in size over time. |
| **Incremental Backup** | Backs up only data changed since the last backup (any type). | Saves space and time. | Requires all backups in sequence for restoration. |

**Tip:**  
Organizations often use a **combination** of these methods to balance storage, speed, and reliability.

---

## Networking and Infrastructure Security

### SYN (TCP) Attacks

- **SYN flood** exploits the **TCP three-way handshake** (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK).
- Attacker sends a large number of SYN packets but never completes the handshake.
- The server holds open connections, exhausting resources and preventing legitimate access.
- **Mitigation:** SYN cookies, limiting half-open connections, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems.

---

### DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

- A **buffer zone network** between the internet and an internal trusted network.
- Hosts public-facing systems such as web, DNS, or mail servers.
- Protects the internal network if an external system in the DMZ is compromised.
- Example: A web server in the DMZ communicates with an internal database via a tightly controlled firewall rule.

---

### Port Ranges and Usage

| Range | Description | Examples |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **0–1023** | Well-known ports for standard services | HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21) |
| **1024–49151** | Registered ports for user or application services | SQL (1433), MySQL (3306) |
| **49152–65535** | Dynamic/private ports for clients | Temporary connections |

Understanding these ranges is critical for **firewall configuration**, **scanning**, and **intrusion detection**.

---

### IDS vs. IPS

| System | Description | Key Function |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** | Monitors and analyzes network or host activity for suspicious patterns. | Alerts security personnel but does not block traffic. |
| **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** | Similar to IDS but can automatically block or reject malicious traffic. | Active defense mechanism that prevents attacks in real time. |

**Example:**  
An IDS might alert you about a port scan, while an IPS would automatically block the scanning host.

---

### Firewalls

**Purpose:**  
To filter network traffic between trusted and untrusted networks according to predefined rules.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Rules:** Define which traffic is allowed or denied.
- **Throughput:** How much data the firewall can process.
- **Software Firewall:** Installed on an individual device (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall).
- **Hardware Firewall:** Dedicated device that protects entire networks.
- **VPN Support:** Allows secure remote access.
- **Direction:**  
  - **Ingress filtering:** Controls incoming traffic.  
  - **Egress filtering:** Controls outgoing traffic.
- **Black Holing:** Silently dropping unwanted traffic.
- **Dual Firewall Setup:** One firewall at the perimeter, another between the DMZ and internal network for layered protection.

## Risk Management and Reliability

### Risk Calculation and Metrics

**Core Formulas:**
- **Exposure Factor (EF):** Percentage of asset value lost due to a single incident.  
- **Asset Value (AV):** Monetary value of the asset.  
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):**
  \[
  SLE = AV \times EF
  \]
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO):** Estimated frequency per year.
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE):**
  \[
  ALE = SLE \times ARO
  \]

**Example:**  
If a $100,000 asset has an exposure factor of 25% and the threat occurs twice a year:
\[
SLE = 100,000 \times 0.25 = 25,000
\]
\[
ALE = 25,000 \times 2 = 50,000
\]
So the annual expected loss is **$50,000**.

### MTTF, MTBF, and MTTR

| Metric | Meaning | Used For |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **MTTF (Mean Time To Failure)** | Average time before a **non-repairable** asset fails. | Single-use systems (e.g., flash drives). |
| **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)** | Average time between **repairable** system failures. | Servers, hardware, or machinery. |
| **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)** | Average time to **detect, diagnose, fix, and validate** a failure. | Maintenance and recovery processes. |

### RTO and RPO

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime after a failure.  
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time.
