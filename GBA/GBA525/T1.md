## Competitive Advantage
Competitive advantage refers to a firm’s ability to create more economic value than its rivals. It exists when a company delivers greater value to customers (through lower cost or differentiation) than competitors can, allowing it to earn above-average returns. Competitive advantage is always relative, not absolute, and must be evaluated within a specific industry context.

## Sustainable Competitive Advantage
A sustainable competitive advantage is a competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to imitate or substitute over time. Sustainability does not mean permanent, but rather that the advantage can persist despite competitive pressures due to barriers such as unique resources, capabilities, culture, or causal ambiguity.

## Red Queen Effect
The Red Queen Effect describes a competitive environment where firms must continuously improve and adapt just to maintain their relative position. Even significant investments in innovation may not lead to lasting advantage because competitors are evolving at the same pace.

## Strategic Leadership
Strategic leadership is the ability to influence others to make decisions that enhance the long-term viability of the organization.
- **Power** refers to the leader’s capacity to influence outcomes due to position, authority, or control of resources.
- **Influence** refers to the leader’s ability to shape perceptions, behaviors, and decisions through persuasion, vision, and credibility.

## Upper-Echelon Theory
Upper-Echelon Theory suggests that organizational outcomes are partially predicted by the characteristics of top executives. Leaders’ experiences, values, personalities, and cognitive biases shape how they interpret situations and make strategic decisions.

## What Corporate, Business, and Functional Strategies Do
Corporate strategy determines *where* the firm competes (industries and markets).
Business strategy determines *how* the firm competes within a particular industry.
Functional strategy focuses on *how each department* supports the business strategy (marketing, operations, finance, HR, etc.).

## Vision Statements
Vision statements articulate a firm’s long-term aspiration.
- **Customer-oriented visions** focus on the value delivered to customers.
- **Product-oriented visions** focus on what the company makes.
Customer-oriented visions are generally more flexible and enduring.

## Values
Values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that guide organizational behavior and decision-making. They shape culture, ethical standards, and strategic priorities.

## Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is a strategic tool that involves imagining multiple plausible future environments. It helps organizations prepare for uncertainty by identifying risks, opportunities, and strategic responses under different assumptions.

## Black Swan Events
Black Swan events are rare, unpredictable occurrences with extreme impact. They are often rationalized after the fact but are difficult to anticipate using traditional forecasting methods.

## Confirmation Bias
Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek, interpret, and prioritize information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. It can severely distort strategic decision-making.

## Devil’s Advocacy
Devil’s advocacy is a structured decision-making technique where someone intentionally challenges assumptions and arguments to expose weaknesses and reduce groupthink.

## PESTEL / Five Forces / Strategic Group Maps
PESTEL analyzes macro-environmental forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal).
Five Forces examines industry attractiveness and competitive intensity.
Strategic Group Maps identify clusters of firms with similar strategies within an industry.

## Complements and Co-opetition
Complements are products or services that increase the value of another product when used together. Co-opetition refers to firms cooperating and competing simultaneously to create and capture value.

## Convergence
Convergence occurs when industries or technologies become more similar over time, often blurring traditional boundaries and intensifying competition.

## Mobility Barriers
Mobility barriers are factors that make it difficult for firms to move between strategic groups within an industry, such as cost structures, brand identity, or technology.

## Core Competencies
Core competencies are unique bundles of skills and capabilities that provide customer value, are difficult to imitate, and can be leveraged across markets.

## Resources—Tangible and Intangible
Tangible resources include physical and financial assets.
Intangible resources include brand reputation, intellectual property, culture, and knowledge.
Intangible resources are often more strategically valuable.

## VRIO
VRIO is a framework for evaluating resources:
- Valuable
- Rare
- Inimitable
- Organized to capture value
Resources meeting all four criteria can generate sustained competitive advantage.

## Path Dependence
Path dependence means that strategic options available today are constrained by past decisions, investments, and routines, even if better alternatives exist.

## Dynamic Capability
Dynamic capabilities are a firm’s abilities to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies in response to changing environments.

## Value Chain
The value chain represents the set of activities a firm performs to create value, from inputs to after-sales service. Analyzing it helps identify sources of cost advantage or differentiation.

## SWOT
SWOT analyzes internal strengths and weaknesses alongside external opportunities and threats to inform strategic choices.

## The Two Competing Characteristics of Great Strategic Leaders
Courage, and Empathy. All Courage produces Tyrants, and all Empathy produces wimps. 

## Emphasis on the Primary Customer
A great strategic leader should be able to easily distinguish who their "most important customer" is, both from the perspective of their role and from the perspective of the business as a whole. This selection dictates how resources are allocated.

## Peanut Butter Allocation
The even allocation of business resources indiscriminantly between SBUs or products / strategies. May seem fair, but is often inefficient and can lead to suboptimal performance. Strategic leaders should allocate resources based on potential return and strategic importance rather than equal distribution.

 - **Staying Close to Your Fire** is a metaphor for relying upon one's core competencies and not straying too far from known successful strategies.
 - **Resilience** is the propensity to keep trying new things in the face of strategic failures, not mindlessly repeat the same unsuccesful course of action.

## Ostrich Effect

## Red Ocean
Conceptual opposite of a Blue Ocean, where the market is highly competitive and saturated, leading to fierce rivalry and limited growth opportunities. In a Red Ocean, companies often engage in price wars and struggle to differentiate themselves.

## Red Ocean Strategy
A Red Ocean Strategy focuses on competing in existing markets, trying to outperform rivals, and capturing a greater share of existing demand. It often involves differentiation or cost leadership within the current industry structure. The firm with the most resources usually wins in a Red Ocean.

## Three Keys to Red Ocean Success
1. Play Hardball - be aggressive and competitive in the market, be singleminded, seek all advantages available.
2. Develop Play to Win Tactics - lead in cost or differentiation, develop a culture of winning at all costs
3. Don't Confuse Tactics with Strategy - tactics are the means to execute strategy, but they are not the strategy itself. A firm must have a clear strategic position and then develop tactics that align with that position, especially when tactics are easily imitated by competitors.
