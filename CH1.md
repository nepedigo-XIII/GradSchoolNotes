## Key Takeaways
- Operations Management (OM) is the business function that plans, coordinates, and controls resources to produce products and services.
- OM transforms inputs (people, materials, technology, information) into outputs (goods & services).
- The goal of OM is to add value by increasing product/service value efficiently (doing activities well, at the lowest possible cost).
- Organizations can be classified as service (intangible, labor-intensive, high customer contact) or manufacturing (tangible, capital-intensive, low customer contact).
- OM decisions are either strategic (long-term, broad scope) or tactical (short-term, day-to-day).
- OM has evolved historically through revolutions in manufacturing (assembly line, Toyota Production System, lean systems).
- Today’s OM requires balancing quality, speed, cost, and information management.
- OM interacts with marketing and finance, sharing critical information to align the whole business.

### Value Added
The net increase between the output’s value and the input’s value; the improvement OM creates during transformation.

### Efficiency
Performing activities well and at the lowest possible cost.

### `Service Organizations`
- Intangible product
- Product can’t be inventoried
- High customer contact
- Short response time
- Labor intensive

### `Manufacturing Organizations`
- Physical product
- Product is inventoried
- Low customer contact
- Longer response time
- Capital intensive

### `Similarities Between Service and Manufacturing`
- Both use technology
- Both face quality, productivity, and response challenges
- Both must forecast demand
- Both deal with capacity, layout, and location issues
- Both involve customers, suppliers, scheduling, and staffing

### `Servitization`
A business model where companies combine products with services, e.g., photocopiers, printers, luxury automobiles.

### `Strategic Decisions`
Broad, long-term decisions that set the direction for the company (e.g., product & process design, facility location).

### `Tactical Decisions`
Day-to-day, short-term decisions that focus on resource needs, scheduling, and production quantities (e.g., inventory, scheduling).

### `Lean Systems`
A total systems approach to efficient operations focusing on eliminating waste, improving quality, and reducing cost.

### `ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)`
