# Made to Stick — Study Guide (Chip Heath & Dan Heath)

> **Source:** *Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die* by Chip Heath and Dan Heath (Random House, 2007)

---

## Overview

This study guide summarizes and structures the full content of the provided PDF excerpt while preserving **all source ideas and examples**.  
The central theme is how to make ideas *sticky* — memorable, understandable, and actionable — by overcoming the **Curse of Knowledge** and applying six principles: **Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories (SUCCESs).**

---

## 1. The Curse of Knowledge

### Core Problem
- Experts know too much, making it hard to communicate with novices.
- Once you know something, it is difficult to imagine not knowing it.

### Tapper and Listener Experiment
- One person taps a song’s rhythm; another guesses it.
- Tappers think it’s obvious because they hear the song in their head.
- Listeners fail because they only hear random taps.

**Lesson:** Ideas fail when we assume others share our context.

---

## 2. Simple – Find and Share the Core

### Find the Core
- Strip ideas to their most essential meaning without oversimplifying.
- The hardest part is pruning important but non‑essential details.

#### Commander’s Intent (CI)
- Military focuses on the **core objective** rather than the full plan.
- Example: Instead of “how to take the bridge,” the CI is simply: **“Take the bridge.”**

#### Inverted Pyramid (Journalism)
1. Most important idea first  
2. Then details  
3. Then background

### Share the Core
- The core message should guide decisions.
- It should be **compact and profound**.

#### Schema & Generative Analogies
- Memory improves when ideas fit existing schemas.
- Examples:
  - JFK FBI is easier to remember than random letters.
  - “Alien is Jaws on a spaceship.”
  - “Pomelo = super‑sized grapefruit.”

---

## 3. Unexpected – Get and Keep Attention

### Why Unexpected Works
- Humans expect patterns; breaking them grabs attention.

### Process for Using the Unexpected
1. Identify the core message  
2. Find what is counter‑intuitive  
3. Break expectations and then rebuild understanding

### Mystery & Curiosity
- Curiosity is created by opening knowledge gaps.
- Local news example: “A new drug sweeping the teenage community… after the break.”

### Examples
- Pocket radio (radios were once furniture)
- JFK: “A man on the moon”

---

## 4. Concrete – Make Ideas Tangible

### Why Concrete Works
- Concrete ideas are easier to remember than abstract ones.
- “Bicycle” beats “justice.”

### Aesop’s Fables
- Example: Fox and the Grapes → “Sour grapes”
- Concrete imagery lasts longer than abstract advice.

### Experts vs Novices
- Experts think abstractly.
- Novices think concretely.
- Curse of Knowledge makes experts forget what beginners need.

---

## 5. Credible – Make People Believe

### How to Build Credibility Without Authority

#### 1. Anti‑Authority
- Dying smoker warning against smoking
- Scientist who swallowed bacteria to prove ulcers were caused by bacteria

#### 2. Concrete Details
- Vivid details create internal credibility
- Jurors trusted cases with more detail

#### 3. Statistics
- Statistics should illustrate relationships, not just numbers
- People remember relationships better than figures

#### 4. The Sinatra Test
- “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere”
- Find the one powerful test case that proves credibility
- Example: Indian FedEx‑like company proving reliability by delivering pirated films

#### 5. Testable Credentials
- Let people verify it themselves
- Wendy’s: “Where’s the Beef?”
- Reagan: “Are you better off than four years ago?”

---

## 6. Emotional – Make People Care

### Why Emotion Matters
- People act when they care.

### Study on Charitable Giving
- Story of one child beats statistics.
- Adding statistics reduces emotional impact.

### Ways to Make People Care
- Create empathy for individuals  
- Associate your idea with what people already care about  
- Appeal to self‑interest and identity  

#### Power of Associations
- Example: “Sportsmanship” reframed as “Honoring the Game”

#### Self‑Interest
- Sell benefits, not features  
  - “Best seed” → “Best lawn”

#### Identity
- People act based on who they are and who they want to be

---

## 7. Stories – Inspire Action

### Why Stories Work
- Stories create mental simulation
- They automatically include:
  - Concrete detail
  - Emotion
  - Unexpected elements

### Subway’s Jared Story
- Discovered story, not invented
- Much stronger than “6 under 7 grams of fat”

### Three Types of Stories

#### 1. Challenge Plot
- Underdog triumphs over adversity  
- Example: Jared losing 245 pounds

#### 2. Connection Plot
- Bridges social gaps  
- Example: Mean Joe Greene commercial

#### 3. Creativity Plot
- Mental breakthroughs and innovation

### Stories Defeat the Curse of Knowledge
- They share context, emotion, and meaning — not just facts

---

## Final Takeaway

Sticky ideas follow **SUCCESs**:

- **Simple** – Find the core  
- **Unexpected** – Break patterns  
- **Concrete** – Make it tangible  
- **Credible** – Make it believable  
- **Emotional** – Make people care  
- **Stories** – Inspire action

# Study Guide: Removing Fluff and Concise Writing

## Purpose of Concision
Concise writing achieves meaning with the fewest necessary words. Concision improves clarity, persuasiveness, and professionalism.

There are two primary methods:
1. **Omitting unnecessary words**
2. **Rewriting sentences while preserving meaning**

---

## Omitting Needless Words

### Principle
William Strunk Jr. summarizes concision as: *omit needless words*. Each word should serve a purpose, just as each part of a machine serves a function.

Alexander Bain similarly argues that language should achieve its ends at the smallest cost.

---

### Eliminating Redundant Words
Some sentences are grammatically correct but contain redundancy.

**Example**
- Original: Her story is a strange one.
- Revised: Her story is strange.

---

### Eliminating Empty Phrases
Phrases like *the fact that* often add no meaning.

**Examples**
- Tek was unaware of the fact that the earth is a sphere.
- Revised: Tek was unaware that the earth is a sphere.

---

### Eliminating Paired Synonyms
Writers sometimes use two words where one will suffice.

**Examples**
- privilege and birthright → privilege
- fades and vanishes → fades
- sharpest and keenest → sharpest
- pure and simple → pure
- provokes and incites → provokes
- shocked and astonished → astonished

The goal is to retain meaning while reducing excess.

---

## Rewriting Sentences

Instead of deleting words, sentences can be rewritten to be more direct.

### The Master Rule
**Replace phrases with a single word whenever possible.**

---

### Replacing Idioms with Verbs
**Examples**
- Turned a blind eye → ignored
- Took no notice → overlooked

---

### Rule 1.1: Replace Negative Phrases
Check whether a negative phrase can be replaced by a single verb or adjective.

**Examples**
- Did not have confidence → distrusted
- Was not paying attention → inattentive

This improves directness and reduces length.

---

### Removing Softened Language
Writers often soften statements to sound polite or indirect.

**Examples**
- Not prepared to approve → rejects
- Not in a position to approve → denies

While indirect language may sound polite, direct wording is clearer and more honest.

---

## Removing Uncertainty in Academic Writing

Beginning writers often hedge claims unnecessarily.

### Common Forms of Uncertainty
- From my point of view
- It seems that
- I believe that

These phrases are often redundant because authorship already implies perspective.

---

### Example Revision
**Original**
- Therefore, from my point of view, theory T seems like it is true.

**Revised**
- Therefore, theory T is true.

Academic writing should focus on defending claims, not expressing uncertainty unless uncertainty is central to the argument.

---

## Connection to Communication Principles

These ideas align with broader communication research emphasizing:
- Simplicity
- Directness
- Cognitive ease
- Reduced reader effort

Clear writing strengthens credibility and persuasion.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Every word should justify its presence
- Replace phrases with precise verbs
- Avoid hedging unless necessary
- Direct writing improves clarity and authority
- Concision is achieved through both deletion and revision
