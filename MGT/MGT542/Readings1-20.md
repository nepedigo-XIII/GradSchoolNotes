# Study Guide: Plain Language Writing

## Overview of Plain Language
Plain language ensures content is **easy to understand for its intended audience**. Research shows comprehension improves with:
- Short words
- Short sections
- Active voice
- Present tense

---

## Active Voice
### Why Active Voice Matters
- Clarifies responsibility
- Reduces ambiguity
- Strengthens sentences

**Active:** The subject performs the action  
**Passive:** The subject receives the action

Passive voice often:
- Hides responsibility
- Uses forms of “to be”
- Includes past participles

Passive voice is appropriate only in limited legal or procedural contexts.

---

## Present Tense
### Benefits
- Simpler
- More direct
- More forceful

Use other tenses only when accuracy requires it.

---

## Hidden Verbs (Nominalizations)
Hidden verbs weaken writing by turning actions into nouns.

### Examples
- “Conduct an analysis” → “Analyze”
- “Responsible for management” → “Manage”

Removing hidden verbs:
- Shortens sentences
- Strengthens clarity
- Reduces passive constructions

---

## Sentence and Paragraph Length
### Sentences
- One main idea per sentence
- Avoid overloaded clauses
- Break complex ideas into steps

### Paragraphs
- Ideal length: 3–8 sentences
- Maximum: 250 words
- One topic per paragraph

Short paragraphs improve readability and visual appeal.

---

## Sections and Headings
- Short sections aid comprehension
- Headings help scanning
- Each section should communicate a single purpose

---

## Familiar Language
### Prefer Common Words
Use familiar terms instead of formal or obscure ones:
- “Use” instead of “utilize”
- “Help” instead of “assist”
- “Must” instead of “shall”

---

## Avoiding “Shall”
“Shall” is:
- Outdated
- Ambiguous
- Aggressive

Use instead:
- **Must** (requirement)
- **Must not** (prohibition)
- **May** (permission)
- **Should** (recommendation)

---

## Noun Strings
Noun strings occur when multiple nouns cluster together.

### Problems
- Reduced readability
- Increased confusion

### Solutions
- Remove unnecessary modifiers
- Add prepositions to clarify meaning

---

## Prepositions and Wordiness
Reduce phrases like:
- “At this point in time” → “Now”
- “In order to” → “To”

---

## Abbreviations
### Best Practices
- Avoid when possible
- Use nicknames instead
- Limit to 2–3 per document
- Define abbreviations on first use

Do not define universally known abbreviations.

---

## Transitions
Transitions help readers follow ideas.

### Types
- Pointing words (this, that)
- Echo links
- Explicit connectives (however, therefore)

---

## Examples
Examples:
- Clarify complex concepts
- Replace long explanations
- Improve reader understanding

Avoid Latin abbreviations like “e.g.” and “i.e.”

---

## Positive Language
### Avoid:
- Double negatives
- Exceptions within exceptions
- Excessive negatives

Positive phrasing improves comprehension.

---

## Avoid Slashes
Slashes create ambiguity.
- Use “and,” “or,” or full explanations instead

---

## Special Writing Cases
### FAQs
- Supplement main content
- Use real user questions
- Keep concise and organized
- Avoid replacing core explanations

### PDFs
PDFs are:
- Harder to read
- Not mobile-friendly
- Slower to load

If used, include descriptive context.

### Links
Effective links:
- Describe destination clearly
- Avoid “click here”
- Support accessibility and SEO

Effective business style prioritizes **clarity, specificity, and professionalism**.

---

## Formal vs. Informal Style
### Formal Style

### Informal Professional Style
- Clear, direct, and active
- Avoids slang but favors simplicity
- Typical of modern U.S. business communication
- Associated with *Plain English*

**Guiding Principle:** When uncertain, favor a clear, specific, active style.

---

## Professional Standards in Style
Effective business writing:
- Is respectful and precise
- Avoids manipulation or excessive emphasis
- Minimizes jargon unless audience expertise requires it
- Does not “talk down” to readers

Ask evaluative questions:

- Does it serve the audience?
- Will it still reflect well on me later?

---

## Tone
Tone reflects your **attitude toward the message and reader**.

### Preferred Business Tone
- Professional
- Engaged
- Serious but not ponderous

Tone problems often arise from:

Diplomatic tone helps:

---

## Voice
Voice reveals personality and stance, such as:

---

## Word Choice
### Goals of Effective Word Choice

## Clarity Through Specificity
Clear writing answers:

Specific examples outperform vague generalities.

---

## Evaluating and Improving Style

1. Read aloud
2. Have someone else read it
