# Communication Directivity, Sensitivity, and Intent

This document provides structured summaries of two related communication frameworks:
1. **Communicating by Intent**
2. **Sensitive vs. Non-Sensitive Communication**

The frameworks are organized to highlight how *purpose* and *risk level* interact in effective communication.

---

## I. Communicating by Intent

Effective communication begins with understanding **what you are trying to do to the audience**. Intent shapes message structure, tone, and delivery, but intent alone does not guarantee the desired impact. Messages often fail when intent is unclear, mixed, or poorly aligned with audience expectations.

### Key Principle
**Intent ≠ Impact**  
A message can be well-intended yet received negatively due to tone, timing, framing, or conflicting goals.

### Multiple Intents
Many messages carry more than one intent (e.g., informing while persuading). When these intents compete, confusion or resistance often follows. Strong communicators prioritize one primary intent.

---

### A. Informational Communication

**Purpose:**  
To transfer knowledge accurately and efficiently.

**Common Contexts:**  
STEM fields, finance, consulting, academia, technical documentation.

**Characteristics:**
- Precision-focused
- Fact-based
- Efficiency-oriented

**Risks:**
- Overuse of jargon
- Assumed prior knowledge
- Information overload

**Key Insight:**  
Clarity requires tailoring complexity to the audience’s background.

---

### B. Persuasive Communication

**Purpose:**  
To influence beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors.

**Common Contexts:**  
Marketing, policy advocacy, leadership messaging, investor communications.

**Characteristics:**
- Appeals to logic *and* emotion
- Audience values matter
- Motivational framing

**Risks:**
- Perceived manipulation
- Hidden agendas
- Loss of trust if intent feels disguised

**Key Insight:**  
Persuasion fails when credibility or transparency is compromised.

---

### C. Directive (Action-Oriented) Communication

**Purpose:**  
To prompt specific action.

**Common Contexts:**  
Management, healthcare, military, operations.

**Characteristics:**
- Clear expectations
- Often time-bound
- Outcome-focused

**Risks:**
- Resistance if tone is abrupt
- Confusion if rationale is missing

**Best Practice:**  
State both **what** needs to be done and **why** it matters.

---

### D. Relational Communication

**Purpose:**  
To build, maintain, or repair relationships.

**Common Contexts:**  
Feedback conversations, mentoring, apologies, team dynamics.

**Characteristics:**
- Emotionally weighted
- Trust-centered
- Often subtle

**Risks:**
- Insincerity
- Tone misalignment
- Lack of follow-through

**Key Insight:**  
Authenticity matters more than wording alone.

---

### E. Entertainment / Engagement Communication

**Purpose:**  
To capture attention and build emotional connection.

**Common Contexts:**  
Branding, internal culture messaging, political communication.

**Characteristics:**
- Humor or storytelling driven
- Designed to be memorable

**Risks:**
- Tone-deafness
- Trivializing serious issues

**Key Insight:**  
Context determines whether engagement enhances or undermines credibility.

---

### When Intents Collide

Communication breaks down when multiple intents compete without a clear priority.

**Common Failures:**
- Feedback mixed with motivation and directives
- Informational messages disguised as persuasion
- Humor paired with serious or sensitive issues

**Core Rule:**  
If multiple intents exist, **one must lead**.

---

## II. Sensitive vs. Non-Sensitive Communication

Not all messages carry equal risk. The key distinction lies in **what is at stake if the message fails**.

### Core Diagnostic Question
**What could go wrong if this message is misunderstood?**

The answer determines whether communication should be treated as non-sensitive or sensitive.

---

### A. Non-Sensitive Communication

**Definition:**  
Messages where misunderstanding is unlikely to cause lasting harm.

**Characteristics:**
- Low emotional impact
- Errors easily corrected
- Trust not immediately threatened

**Common Examples:**
- Scheduling emails
- Routine updates
- Status reports
- Standard instructions

**Typical Failures:**
- Vagueness
- Information overload
- Unclear action items

**Why These Failures Are Fixable:**  
Confusion can be resolved through clarification without emotional repair.

**Primary Goal:**  
Efficiency and clarity.

---

### B. Sensitive Communication

**Definition:**  
Messages where poor delivery can cause lasting emotional, relational, legal, or reputational harm.

**Characteristics:**
- High emotional load
- Threat to identity, status, or security
- Power dynamics often present

**Common Examples:**
- Performance evaluations
- Layoffs or restructuring
- Ethical or compliance issues
- Conflict resolution
- DEI-related messaging

**Typical Failures:**
- Over-reliance on logic
- Defensive tone
- Minimizing emotional impact
- Rushing delivery

**Why These Failures Are Costly:**
When people feel threatened, they:
- Focus on tone over content
- Interpret ambiguity negatively
- Lose trust rapidly

**Primary Goal:**  
Trust preservation and harm reduction.

---

### Sensitivity Is Context-Dependent

The same statement can be non-sensitive or highly sensitive depending on:
- Who is affected
- What they stand to lose
- Whether consequences are permanent

Sensitivity is determined by **impact**, not intent.

---

### Why Misclassification Happens

Common reasons communicators underestimate sensitivity:
- Emotional distance from consequences
- Focus on efficiency
- Ignoring power dynamics
- Assuming intent ensures understanding

This leads to using low-risk strategies for high-risk messages.

---

### Practical Risk Assessment Checklist

Before delivering a message, consider:
- What could the recipient lose?
- Does this affect identity, status, or security?
- Would failure require emotional repair?
- Would public exposure cause harm?

If risk is high, the message should be treated as sensitive.

## Purpose of Communication Effectiveness Measurement
Communication effectiveness measurement evaluates how well organizational messages are:
- **Delivered**
- **Understood**

The primary objective is to ensure frontline workers receive clear, relevant, and actionable information that supports operational performance and engagement.

### 4. Accessibility
- Employees can easily access information when needed

- Feedback loops are closed

## Measurement Methods
Common methods used to assess communication effectiveness include:

### Surveys
- Pulse surveys
- Engagement surveys
- Communication-specific questionnaires

Key metrics:
- Understanding of messages
- Perceived usefulness
- Confidence in leadership communication

### Focus Groups and Interviews
