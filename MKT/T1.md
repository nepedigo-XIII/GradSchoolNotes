### Basic Cost and Contribution Formulas

$$  
F = \text{Total Fixed Cost}  
$$  
 

$$  
V = \text{Total Variable Cost}  
$$    

$$  
Q = \text{Total Sales Units}  
$$  
 

$$  
S = \text{Total Sales Revenue}  
$$  



$$  
p = \text{Price per Unit}  
$$  

  

$$  
c = \text{Cost per Unit}  
$$  

  

$$  
PCM = \text{Percentage Contribution Margin}  
$$  


$$  
\text{Sales Revenue} = pQ  
$$  


$$  
\text{Variable Cost} = cQ  
$$  


$$  
u = p - c  
$$  

**u:** Unit contribution margin — the amount each unit contributes to covering fixed costs and profit.  

$$  
PCM = \frac{p - c}{p} = \frac{u}{p}  
$$  

**Percentage contribution margin = contribution per unit ÷ selling price.**  

$$  
G = S - V = pQ - cQ = (p - c)Q = uQ = S \times PCM  
$$  

**G:** Gross contribution — total contribution toward fixed costs and profit.  

---

### Net Income and Break-Even Formulas

$$  
\text{Net Income} = G - F  
$$  

**N:** Net income (profit) = gross contribution – fixed costs.  

$$  
N = S - V - F  
$$  

**Net income = sales revenue – variable costs – fixed costs.**

$$  
N = pQ - cQ - F  
$$  

$$  
N = (p - c)Q - F  
$$  

$$  
N = uQ - F  
$$  


$$  
N = S \times PCM - F  
$$  

All represent equivalent ways to calculate net profit.

### Break-even Sales Units

$$  
Q^* = \frac{F}{u} = \frac{F}{p - c}  
$$  

**Q\***: Break-even quantity — the number of units needed to sell to cover all fixed and variable costs.  

---

### Break-even Sales Revenue

$$  
S^* = pQ^* = p \left( \frac{F}{u} \right) = p \left( \frac{F}{p - c} \right) = \frac{Fp}{p - c} = \frac{F}{PCM}  
$$  

**S\***: Break-even sales revenue — total dollar sales required to break even.  

---

## Break-Even with Profit Goal

### Sales Units with Profit Goal

$$  
Q^{**} = \frac{F + N}{p - c} = \frac{F + N}{u}  
$$  

**Q\*\***: Units required to achieve a specific target profit (N).  

---

### Sales Units for Profit Goal Only

$$  
Q^{**} = \frac{N}{p - c} = \frac{N}{u}  
$$  

**Q\*\*** (profit only): Units required to earn a profit N *beyond* fixed costs already covered.  

---

### Sales Revenue with Profit Goal

$$  
S^{**} = pQ^{**} = p \left( \frac{F + N}{u} \right) = p \left( \frac{F + N}{p - c} \right) = \frac{(F + N)p}{p - c} = \frac{F + N}{PCM}  
$$  

**S\*\***: Break-even sales revenue with profit goal — total revenue required to cover both fixed costs and profit target.  

---

## Sales Revenue for Profit Goal Only

$$  
S^{**} = pQ^{**} = p \left( \frac{N}{u} \right) = p \left( \frac{N}{p - c} \right) = \frac{Np}{p - c} = \frac{N}{PCM}  
$$  

**S\*\*** (profit only): Sales revenue required to achieve the profit goal after fixed costs are already covered.  

---

### Market Share

$$  
\text{Market Share} = \frac{\text{Total Sales Units } (Q)}{\text{Total Market Units}}  
$$  

**Market Share:** Portion of total market sales captured by your product.  

---

### Break-even Share

$$  
\text{Break-even Share} = \frac{\text{Break-even Sales Units } (Q^* \text{ or } Q^{**})}{\text{Total Market Units}}  
$$  

**Break-even Share:** Minimum market share required to reach break-even or target profit.  

---

## Pricing and Distribution

$$  
RSP = \frac{MSP}{1 - m}  
$$  

**RSP:** Retail Selling Price  
**MSP:** Manufacturer Selling Price  
**m:** Retailer margin (as a decimal).  

$$  
MSP = RSP(1 - m)  
$$  

---

### Two Intermediaries

$$  
RSP = \frac{MSP}{(1 - m_1)(1 - m_2)}  
$$  

$$  
MSP = RSP(1 - m_1)(1 - m_2)  
$$  

**m₁, m₂:** Margins of intermediary 1 and 2 respectively.  

---

## Price Elasticity

$$  
E = \frac{\Delta Q / Q}{\Delta P / P}  
$$  



**E:** Price elasticity of demand — measures sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes.

## Salesforce Size Formula

$$  
\text{Salesforce Size} = \frac{(\text{Number of Customers} \times \text{Frequency of Calls} \times \text{Length of Call})}{\text{Available Selling Time per Representative}}  
$$  

**Salesforce Size:** Number of salespeople required based on workload and available time.
