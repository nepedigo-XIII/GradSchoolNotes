## What Is Strategy?

- **Definition**:  
  Strategy is the integrated set of choices that positions a business in its industry to generate **superior financial returns** over the long run.  
  (Jan Rivkin)

- **Purpose of Strategy**:  
  1. To create a **sustainable competitive advantage**  
  2. To generate **superior** and **sustainable financial returns**

- **Two Fundamental Questions**:  
  - **Where to compete?** (Industry/market selection — understanding the business landscape and profitability)  
  - **How to compete?** (Choosing a position or business model — unlocking profitability)

## Schools of Thought in Strategy

1. **Industry-Structure View (External Focus)**  
   - Associated with Michael Porter  
   - Tools:  
     - **Five Forces**  
     - **Generic Strategies**  
   - Focuses on how industry forces shape profitability.

2. **Resource-Based View (Internal Focus)**  
   - Associated with Birger Wernerfelt and Jay Barney  
   - Key concept: **VRIN framework** (resources must be Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, and Non-substitutable to create sustained advantage).

## Industry-Structure View (Porter’s Framework)

Industry accounts for **10–20% of profitability**.  
The key question: _What allows or prevents companies in certain industries from extracting more economic rents?_

### Porter’s Five Forces

The five forces determine the overall **profitability** of an industry:

1. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**  
   - Customers (B2C or B2B) can squeeze industry profit margins.  
   - Determinants:  
     - Size/concentration of buyers  
     - Price sensitivity  
     - Availability of alternatives  
     - Low risk of switching  
   - Example: Airline passengers are very price sensitive → **High Buyer Power**

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**  
   - Suppliers can increase input costs, reducing industry profitability.  
   - Determinants:  
     - Supplier concentration vs. fragmented buyers  
     - Differentiated or unique inputs  
     - Switching costs  
   - Example: Aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus) or engine providers (GE, Rolls Royce) → **High Supplier Power**

3. **Intensity of Rivalry**  
   - Aggressive competition reduces profitability.  
   - Manifestations: price wars, advertising wars, frequent product introductions.  
   - Determinants:  
     - Many similar-sized competitors  
     - Low product differentiation  
     - High fixed costs, overcapacity  
     - Slow industry growth  
   - Example: Airlines → **High Rivalry**

4. **Threat of New Entrants**  
   - New competitors erode profits by increasing supply and competition.  
   - Entry barriers determine this force:  
     - Capital requirements  
     - Proprietary knowledge  
     - Economies of scale  
     - Strong brands  
     - Contracts and regulations  
   - Example: Post-deregulation airlines saw many new entrants → **Medium Threat**

5. **Threat of Substitutes**  
   - Products from outside the industry that satisfy the same need.  
   - Example: Cars, trains, and buses substitute for airlines → **High Threat**  
   - Substitutes cap the ability to charge high prices.

### 5 Forces Analysis Outcomes

- Identifies **which forces are threats** to industry profitability.  
- Identifies **which forces are opportunities**.  
- Helps assess whether competitors face the same or different industry pressures.

## Strategic Analysis Frameworks

### External Analysis

1. **5Cs Framework**  
   - **Company**: Define mission, objectives, resources, capabilities  
   - **Competitors**: Who are they, how do they compete, how strong are they?  
   - **Customers**: Needs, preferences, segments, willingness to pay  
   - **Collaborators**: Suppliers, partners, distributors, stakeholders  
   - **Context**: Macro-environmental trends (economic, social, political, etc.)  

2. **PESTEL Analysis**  
   - **Political**: Government policy, regulations, trade restrictions  
   - **Economic**: Growth, inflation, exchange rates, interest rates  
   - **Social**: Demographics, cultural trends, consumer behaviors  
   - **Technological**: Innovations, automation, R&D, digital disruption  
   - **Environmental**: Sustainability, climate change, ecological constraints  
   - **Legal/Regulatory**: Laws, industry regulations, compliance issues  

3. **Five Forces Analysis** (explained above)

### Internal Analysis

1. **VRIN Framework** (Resource-Based View)  
   For a resource to provide **sustained competitive advantage**, it must be:  
   - **Valuable**: Contributes to value creation for customers  
   - **Rare**: Not widely possessed by competitors  
   - **Inimitable**: Hard to copy due to unique history, causal ambiguity, or social complexity  
   - **Non-substitutable**: No strategic equivalent resources exist  

2. **SWOT Analysis**  
   - **Strengths**: Internal capabilities that provide advantage  
   - **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations that hinder performance  
   - **Opportunities**: External chances to grow or improve profits  
   - **Threats**: External factors that could damage competitiveness  

3. **Company Functions in Internal Analysis**  
   - **Management**: Leadership, decision-making structures  
   - **Marketing**: Brand equity, positioning, customer relationships  
   - **Manufacturing**: Efficiency, capacity, cost management  
   - **R&D**: Innovation, product pipelines, patents  
   - **Finance**: Access to capital, cost structures, profitability  
   - **Offerings**: Breadth and depth of product/service portfolio

## Costs and Value Capture

At its core, strategy is about creating **added value**:

$$
\text{Added Value} = \text{Willingness to Pay} - \text{Costs of Inputs}
$$

- **Willingness to Pay (WTP)**: The maximum a customer is willing to pay for your product/service.  
- **Costs of Inputs**: The resources and expenses required to produce and deliver the offering.  
- Firms seek to expand the gap between WTP and costs, while preventing rivals from imitating.

## Generic Strategies (Porter)

1. **Cost Leadership**: Be the lowest-cost producer.  
   - Broad market scope, low cost.  
   - Requires efficiency, economies of scale, cost control.  

2. **Differentiation**: Offer unique products/services that customers value.  
   - Broad market scope, unique value.  
   - Requires branding, innovation, quality, service.  

3. **Focus**: Concentrate on a narrow market niche.  
   - **Cost focus**: Lowest cost in a specific niche.  
   - **Differentiation focus**: Unique offerings tailored to a specific segment.

## Marketing Strategy Linkages

- **STP Framework**:  
  - **Segmentation**: Divide market into customer groups with similar needs.  
  - **Targeting**: Select which segments to serve.  
  - **Positioning**: Craft a value proposition and brand perception in the customer’s mind.  

- **4Ps (Marketing Mix)**:  
  - **Product**: Features, quality, design, brand, service.  
  - **Price**: Pricing strategy, discounts, value perception.  
  - **Place**: Distribution channels, retail, logistics.  
  - **Promotion**: Advertising, sales promotion, PR, digital marketing.
