## **`I. External Analysis`**

### 1. PESTEL Framework
**Purpose:**  
Analyzes **macro-environmental factors** that can affect an organization.

| Factor | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **P â€“ Political** | Government policy, stability, taxation, trade laws, and regulation. |
| **E â€“ Economic** | Inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, GDP growth, disposable income. |
| **S â€“ Sociocultural** | Demographics, lifestyle trends, education, cultural norms, and social values. |
| **T â€“ Technological** | Innovation rate, automation, R&D, digital transformation. |
| **E â€“ Environmental** | Sustainability, climate change, resource scarcity, eco-regulations. |
| **L â€“ Legal** | Employment law, consumer protection, IP rights, safety regulations. |

### 2. Five Forces Framework (Porter)
**Purpose:**  
Evaluates the **competitive structure** of an industry and its **profit potential**.

| Force | Description | Example of Power |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **1. Competitive Rivalry** | Intensity of competition among existing firms. | High rivalry reduces prices and profit margins. |
| **2. Threat of New Entrants** | Ease with which new competitors can enter the market. | Low barriers to entry increase competition. |
| **3. Threat of Substitutes** | Availability of products meeting similar needs. | Substitutes cap industry pricing power. |
| **4. Bargaining Power of Buyers** | Ability of customers to influence price or quality. | Few buyers + standardized product = high buyer power. |
| **5. Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | Influence of suppliers on input costs and availability. | Few suppliers or differentiated input = high supplier power. |

#### ðŸ’¡ Types of Power in Five Forces
- **Buyer Power:** Comes from **concentration**, **price sensitivity**, **information**, and **switching ease**.
- **Supplier Power:** Stems from **input uniqueness**, **few substitutes**, **importance of supplier to buyer**, and **threat of forward integration**.
- **Competitive Power:** Determined by **market growth**, **exit barriers**, **product differentiation**, and **cost structure**.

### 3. 5Cs Framework
**Purpose:**  
Used to analyze the **marketing environment** and **strategic context**.

| C | Focus Area | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Company** | Internal strengths and weaknesses. | Brand equity, financial resources, capabilities. |
| **Customers** | Target market and segmentation. | Needs, behaviors, lifetime value, satisfaction. |
| **Competitors** | Rivals in the market. | Direct and indirect competitors, positioning. |
| **Collaborators** | External partners and intermediaries. | Suppliers, distributors, alliances. |
| **Context** | Macro-environmental factors. | Ties in with PESTEL influences. |

##  **`II. Internal Analysis`**

### 1. VRIN Framework
**Purpose:**  
Used to assess whether a firmâ€™s resources and capabilities can lead to **sustained competitive advantage**.

| Criterion | Definition | Strategic Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **V â€“ Valuable** | Helps the firm exploit opportunities or neutralize threats. | Contributes to efficiency or differentiation. |
| **R â€“ Rare** | Possessed by few current and potential competitors. | Creates temporary advantage. |
| **I â€“ Inimitable** | Difficult or costly to copy (e.g., due to unique history, causal ambiguity, social complexity). | Sustains advantage. |
| **N â€“ Non-substitutable** | No equivalent resources that can replace it. | Maintains competitive moat. |

âœ… **If all four are met**, the firm has a **sustainable competitive advantage**.

---

### 2. Resource-Based View (RBV)
**Purpose:**  
Focuses on a firmâ€™s **internal resources and capabilities** as the source of competitive advantage.

- **Resources:** Tangible (plant, cash) and intangible (brand, IP, culture) assets.
- **Capabilities:** The firmâ€™s ability to deploy resources effectively.

> Sustainable advantage arises when resources are **VRIN** and well-organized for exploitation.

---

### 3. Operating Leverage

**Definition:**  
Measures the extent to which a firmâ€™s **fixed costs** are used in production.  
High operating leverage means **profits are more sensitive** to sales changes.

Formula:

$$
\text{Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)} = 
\frac{\%\ \text{Change in Operating Income}}{\%\ \text{Change in Sales}}
$$

or equivalently,

$$
\text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Contribution Margin}}{\text{Operating Income}}
$$

**Implication:**  
- High fixed costs â†’ higher leverage â†’ higher risk but higher potential returns.  
- Low fixed costs â†’ lower leverage â†’ more stability but lower profit growth.

## **`III. Market Strategy and Positioning`**

### 1. Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning (STP)

| Stage | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Segmentation** | Divide the market into groups with similar needs or behaviors. |
| **Targeting** | Evaluate segments and select which to serve. |
| **Positioning** | Design a marketing mix to occupy a distinct place in the customerâ€™s mind. |

**Positioning Statement Template:**
> For *[Target Segment]*, *[Brand]* is the *[Frame of Reference]* that *[Point of Difference]* because *[Reason to Believe]*.

---

### 2. The Marketing Mix (4Ps)

| Element | Key Questions | Examples |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Product** | What are we offering? Features, design, brand, quality, service. | Apple iPhone, Starbucks coffee. |
| **Price** | How much do we charge? Strategy, discounts, payment methods. | Premium pricing, penetration pricing. |
| **Place** | Where and how do we distribute? Channels, logistics, coverage. | Online stores, retailers, direct sales. |
| **Promotion** | How do we communicate value? | Advertising, PR, personal selling, social media. |

> Sometimes extended to **7Ps**: adds **People**, **Process**, and **Physical Evidence** for services marketing.

### 3. Generic Strategies (Porter)

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Cost Leadership** | Compete on lowest cost per unit. | Walmart, McDonaldâ€™s. |
| **Differentiation** | Offer unique features and premium value. | Apple, BMW. |
| **Focus (Cost or Differentiation)** | Target a niche market with a cost or differentiation edge. | Tesla (differentiation focus). |

> Warning: Firms caught in the middle (no clear strategy) often perform poorly.

## ðŸ§© IV. Integration & Strategic Fit

- **External Analysis (PESTEL, 5 Forces, 5Cs)** â†’ Identifies **opportunities and threats**.  
- **Internal Analysis (VRIN, RBV, Operating Leverage)** â†’ Reveals **strengths and weaknesses**.  
- **Strategic Frameworks (STP, 4Ps, Generic Strategies)** â†’ Define **how to compete** and **create value**.

**Strategic Fit Equation (Conceptually):**

$$
\text{Sustainable Competitive Advantage} = 
f(\text{External Opportunities}, \text{Internal Strengths})
$$
