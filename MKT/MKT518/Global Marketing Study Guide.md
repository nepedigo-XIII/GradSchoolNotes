## Global Marketing Strategy Overview

Global marketing involves planning, pricing, promoting, and distributing offerings in **more than one country** for profit.

World trade is driven by:

- **Global competition**
- **Global companies**
- **Global consumers**

Over 40% of S&P 500 profits come from international markets.

---

## Growth Strategies (Ansoff Framework)

- **Market Penetration** – Increase sales of existing products in existing markets.
- **Product Development** – Create new products for existing markets.
- **Market Development** – Sell existing products in new markets (domestic or international).
- **Diversification** – New products in new markets.

International expansion usually follows domestic market saturation.

---

## Why Firms Go Global

1. **Access new buyers** → revenue, profits, long-term growth.  
2. **Use transferable competencies** → technology, brand, processes.  
3. **Spread business risk** → diversify market exposure.  
4. **Achieve lower costs** → economies of scale, purchasing, production efficiency.

## Identifying Global Market Opportunities

### Steps:
1. Develop country screening criteria.
2. Gather comparative data.
3. Assess market attractiveness.
4. Prioritize countries.
5. Compare opportunities to firm capabilities (internal analysis).

### Screening Criteria

**Quantitative**
- Market size
- Profit potential
- Demographics
- Usage rates

**Qualitative**
- Sociocultural fit  
- Technology and infrastructure  
- Legal & political systems  
- Competitive environment  

Analytical tools: **PESTL**, **5 Forces**, **SWOT**, **5Cs**.

## Uppsala Model of Internationalization

Firms internationalize gradually:

1. No regular exports  
2. Exports via independent agents  
3. Foreign sales subsidiary  
4. Foreign production subsidiary  

Firms begin in markets with low:
- **Cultural distance**
- **Psychic distance** (managerial perception of differences)

**Born global firms** break this pattern and internationalize rapidly.

---

## International Market Entry Modes

### 1. **Exporting**
Least change to current operations.

#### Indirect Exporting
- Uses intermediaries.
- Low cost, low risk, low profit.
- Best for SMEs or limited volumes.

#### Direct Exporting
- No intermediaries.
- Higher profit potential.
- Higher costs, more control.

---

### 2. **Licensing**
Licensor grants rights to IP in exchange for royalties.

**Advantages:**
- Low risk
- Fast
- Low capital requirement

**Disadvantages:**
- Lost profit potential
- Loss of control
- Risk of creating future competitor

#### Variations:
- **Franchising**  
- **Contract manufacturing/assembly**

---

### 3. **Joint Venture**
Foreign and local firms create a jointly owned entity.

**Drivers:**
- Resource and capability complementarities  
- Legal or regulatory requirements  

Challenges:
- Partner selection
- Control issues
- Relationship management
- Knowledge sharing

---

### 4. **Direct Investment**
Wholly-owned subsidiaries or acquisitions abroad.

**Advantages:**
- Highest control
- Cost efficiency
- Strong local market understanding

**Disadvantages:**
- Highest risk
- Highest capital commitment

Often follows exporting, licensing, or joint ventures.

---

## Criteria for Choosing a Market Entry Mode

- **Speed & Timing** – How fast must we enter?
- **Costs** – Initial investment & ongoing cost structure.
- **Risk & Uncertainty**
- **Flexibility & Control**
- **Return on Investment**  
- **Long-term strategic objectives**

---

## Standardization vs Adaptation

“The art of global marketing is standardizing where possible and adapting where needed.”

### Standardization Benefits
- Economies of scale  
- Consistent brand image  
- Operational efficiency  

### Adaptation Drivers
- Customer preferences  
- Climate / physical environment  
- Local product use behaviors  
- Regulatory constraints  
- Infrastructure differences  

Adaptation increases cost; must produce additional revenue to justify.

---

## Factors Influencing Standardization/Adaptation

### A) **Customer Needs**
Climate, consumption habits, culture, usage patterns.

### B) **Regulation**
Standards, safety regulations, voltage norms, import laws, advertising laws.

---

## Offering Adaptation

Examples:
- BMW and VW adjusting **cupholder size** in U.S.
- Appliances modified for local usage patterns.
- Refrigerators, washing machine settings, etc.

---

## Channel Adaptation

Example:  
Dell added retail stores in China and India because first-time buyers preferred **face-to-face** assistance.

Retail design adapts architecture, layout, and customer experience based on local expectations.

---

## Pricing Adaptation

Influenced by:
- Competitive environment  
- Taxes, tariffs, duties  
- Exchange rates  
- Local legal constraints  

Example:  
Walmart prohibited from selling below cost in Germany → forced exit.

---

## Promotion Adaptation

Advertising messages may require full customization.

Example:  
Pepsi dominates Quebec due to decades of locally tailored advertising.

---

## Global Market Segmentation & Targeting

Firms segment globally using:
- Socioeconomic variables  
- Behavioral variables  
- Psychographic patterns  

Global segments:
- Middle income (IKEA)
- Youth (Nike, Apple)
- Affluent elite (Chanel, Gucci)

---

## Global Brands & Positioning

A global brand:
- Uses the same name across countries.
- Uses centrally coordinated marketing.
- Communicates consistent benefits.

Ideal global brand categories:
- High-tech (Sony, Rolex)
- High-image / luxury (Armani, Tiffany)
- Service & B2B (AmEx, HP)
- Retailers serving specific global segments (IKEA)
- Country-of-origin based brands (Volkswagen)

Global brands remain consistent unless adaptation is essential.

---

## Key Conceptual Formula Areas

(Global marketing has few numeric models; formulas relate to strategic evaluation.)

### Market Attractiveness Score

$$
\text{Attractiveness} 
= \sum (W_i \times S_i)
$$

Where:  
- \( W_i \) = weight of criterion  
- \( S_i \) = score of country on criterion  



### Market–Firm Fit Evaluation

$$
\text{Fit Score} = 
\text{Market Requirements} - \text{Firm Capabilities Gap}
$$



### Risk Assessment Index

$$
\text{Risk Index} =
\sum (W_j \times R_j)
$$



These formulas support **option analysis** in global expansion decisions.
