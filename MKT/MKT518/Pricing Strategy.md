# Pricing Strategy & Management – Comprehensive Study Guide

Marketing creates value for customers and the firm. Pricing captures value by generating revenue and profit.

---

## Value Creation & Capture

- **Product**: creates value.
- **Promotion**: communicates value.
- **Place**: delivers value.
- **Price**: captures value.

Pricing must align with the target market and positioning strategy.

---

## Importance of Pricing

- Influences customer types and competitive position.
- Pricing errors can erase gains from product, communication, or distribution.
- Affects revenue, cost, and profit.

$$
\text{Profit} = (P \times Q) - TC
$$

---

## Customer Value & Price Perception

Value increases when:
- Perceived benefits increase.
- Price decreases.

Price is also a **signal** of quality or prestige.

Consumers compare offerings relative to substitutes, forming a **reference value**.

---

## True Economic Value (TEV), Perceived Value & Reference Value

### True Economic Value

$$
\text{TEV} = \text{Cost of Next-Best Alternative} + \text{Performance Differential Value}
$$

### Incentives

$$
\text{Customer Incentive} = \text{Perceived Value} - \text{Price}
$$

$$
\text{Firm Incentive} = \text{Price} - \text{Unit Variable Cost}
$$

---

## Cognitive Biases in Pricing

- **Anchoring**
- **Availability bias**
- **Sunk cost fallacy**
- **Confirmation bias**
- **Gambler’s fallacy**

System 1 (fast) thinking dominates consumer price responses.

---

## Price–Quantity Relationship & Elasticity

Price elasticity measures responsiveness of quantity to price changes.

$$
E = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}
$$

### Elastic Demand
- \( E > 1 \)
- Quantity highly responsive.

### Inelastic Demand
- \( E < 1 \)
- Quantity weakly responsive.

Factors: differentiation, substitutes, competitive intensity, buyer power.

---

## Price Customization

Different customers have different willingness to pay (WTP).

Ways to customize:
- **Buyer characteristics** (age, affiliation).
- **Transaction characteristics** (quantity, timing).
- **Product-line pricing** (entry, mid, premium tiers).
- **Selective availability** of prices.

---

## Product-Line Pricing & Cross Elasticity

Cross elasticity indicates how products affect each other's demand.

### Complements

$$
\downarrow P_A \Rightarrow \uparrow Q_B
$$

### Substitutes

$$
\downarrow P_A \Rightarrow \downarrow Q_B
$$

Product lines must be priced to maximize **total line profit**, not individual SKU profit.

## New Offering Pricing Strategies

### Skimming
High initial price → lowered over time.  
Used when demand is inelastic or product is unique.

### Penetration
Low initial price to gain share.  
Used when demand is elastic and economies of scale exist.

### Intermediate Pricing
Most common—between the extremes.

---

## Pricing, Competition & Price Wars

Price wars occur when competitors repeatedly cut prices.

Dangerous because:
- No firm benefits long-term.
- Industry profits collapse.

Only consider price cuts when:
- Firm has true cost advantage.
- Price cut increases primary demand.
- Price cut is targeted.

---

## Cost-Based Pricing Strategies

### Full-Cost Methods

**Markup Pricing**

$$
P = C + \text{Markup}
$$

**Break-Even Pricing**

$$
P = UVC + UFC
$$

**Rate-of-Return Pricing**
Price chosen to meet ROI target.

### Variable-Cost (Contribution) Pricing

Used when:
- Excess capacity exists.
- Fixed costs dominate.

Any price above variable cost contributes to profit.

Two uses:
1. **Stimulate demand**  
2. **Shift demand** (peak → off-peak)
