# **16. Break-Even Analysis for Salesforce Choice**

Given:
- Company sales force = fixed cost + % commission  
- Independent reps = % commission only  

Break-even sales level **S** occurs where:
```
FixedCost + (CompanyCommission × S) = (RepCommission × S)
```

From slide example:
- Break-even ≈ **$25 million**  

Below $25M → reps cheaper  
Above $25M → internal sales force cheaper

Advertising response curve:
- Diminishing returns  
- Saturation point  
- Wasteful beyond certain levels  

---

NS = (NC × FC × LC) / TA
```

Where:

- **FC** = Frequency of calls required  
- **LC** = Length of average call  
- **TA** = Total available selling time
