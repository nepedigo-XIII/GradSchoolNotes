## 1. Structure vs. Investment Vehicle  

**Structures**  
- 401(k)  
- IRA  
- 403(b)  
- Brokerage account  
- Wealth manager, etc.  

**Investment Vehicles**  
- Direct ownership (non-delegated)  
- Mutual funds  
- ETFs  
- Closed-end funds  
- Hedge funds  
- Private equity vehicles  
- Defined benefit pension plans  

---

## 2. Types of Delegated Investments  

### Key U.S. Laws
- **1933 Securities Act**  
- **1934 Exchange Act**  
- **1940 Investment Company Act**  

**Purpose of These Acts**  
- Regulate disclosure, trading, and investment company structure.  
- Protect investors through transparency and oversight.  

**Securities Exempt from These Acts**  
- Government securities  
- Municipal bonds  
- Private placements, etc.  

**How These Laws Have Changed**  
- Increased disclosure requirements  
- Greater limits on leverage and risk-taking  
- Tightened rules on fee transparency  

---

## 3. The Law of Delegated Investments  

- Investment **intermediation can be nested**  
  - Example: a mutual fund can own another mutual fund.  
- **Fees compound** through layers of intermediation.  
- Fewer levels are generally **more efficient** for investors.  

---

## 4. Mutual Funds  

- Pooled investment vehicle.  
- Investors own **units (shares)** of the pool.  
- Valuation and transactions occur **once per day**, typically after **4 PM** when **NAV** is calculated.  
- **Open-ended** — money can flow in and out freely.  

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

$$
\text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

---

## 5. Closed-End Funds  

- Similar to mutual funds, but **traded like stocks**.  
- Conduct an **IPO** (e.g., raise \$100 million for 1 million shares → \$100 per share).  
- Shares trade on **secondary markets**.  
- Price depends on:  
  - Value of underlying investments  
  - Perceived skill of the manager  

---

## 6. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)  

- Like mutual funds, but **traded on exchanges**.  
- Usually track a **publicly viewable index**.  
- Have a **create/redeem mechanism** that:  
  - Maintains price near NAV  
  - Handles inflows and outflows  
  - Ensures liquidity  

### ETF Data and Analysis
- Sector analysis  
- Growth over time  
- ETF data differ significantly from stock-level data

## 7. Hedge Funds  

**Original Intention**  
- Long/short strategies provided sufficient “hedge” or edge.  

**Modern Characteristics**  
- Heavy use of **leverage**, **short positions**, **derivatives**, and **alternative assets**.  
- Compensation structure: **“2 and 20”** (2% management, 20% incentive).  
- Sometimes includes a **high-water mark** feature.  

---

## 8. What Do People Want?  

**Investors want:**  
- High, risk-adjusted returns  

**Fund managers want:**  
- Higher compensation and AUM (Assets Under Management)  

**Result:**  
- Potential misalignment of incentives → excessive risk-taking  

---

## 9. Fund Manager Compensation  

### Mutual Funds  
- Paid via an **expense ratio**  
- Ways to increase compensation:  
  - Increase **flows**  
  - Get promoted to manage larger funds  
  - Leave to start a hedge fund  

### Hedge Funds  
- “**2/20**” contract  
- May include **high-water marks**  
- Also benefit from flows and fund size  

---

## 10. Hedge Fund Compensation Contracts  

### “2 and 20” Structure  

- **2% Management Fee:**  
  Like an expense ratio, applied to total AUM.  

- **20% Incentive Fee:**  
  Managers receive 20% of profits but **0% of losses**.  

Often combined with a **High-Water Mark (HWM)** feature.

---

## 11. High-Water Mark (HWM)  

**Definition:**  
Incentive fees can **only** be charged on **new profits** — i.e., profits exceeding the fund’s previous peak value.  

### Example Formula  

$$
\text{Incentive Fee} = 0.20 \times \max(0, \text{Current NAV} - \text{High Water Mark})
$$

### Advantages  
- Prevents paying multiple incentive fees for the same performance  
- Penalizes poor performance  

### Disadvantages  
- May discourage managers after large losses (“performance reset”)  

---

## 12. Mutual Fund Compensation  

- Typically only an **expense ratio** (10–100 basis points).  
- Under the **1940 Act**, fees must be **symmetric**:  
  - If managers earn more on upside, they must lose on downside.  

### “Fulcrum Fee” Structure (Rare)  
A few funds use a **fulcrum fee**, where compensation adjusts symmetrically with performance.

---

## 13. Risk-Taking Incentives and Flows  

Even with only expense ratios, mutual funds have **risk-taking incentives** due to:  
- **Asymmetric flow responses** — better performance attracts more investor capital.  

### Empirical Study  
(Chevalier and Ellison, 1997) — Managers take more risk when potential inflows are high.

---

## 14. What Tempers Risk-Taking?  

While incentives encourage effort and higher performance, they are tempered by:  
- Reputational risk  
- Job loss or firing  
- Loss of investor confidence and AUM  

### Real Downside of Poor Performance  
- Loss of future earnings potential  
- Exit from industry or inability to raise future capital
