# Project Selection and Real Options — Study Guide

## Payback Period
- **Definition:** Measures how quickly you recover your initial investment.  
- **Formula:**  

$$
\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Annual Cash Inflow}}
$$  


---

## Net Present Value (NPV)
- **Definition:** Value of a project in today’s dollars, discounting future cash flows at the appropriate discount rate (WACC).  
- **Decision Rule:** Accept the project if NPV > 0.  

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} - C_0
$$  

Where:  
- \( CF_t \) = cash flow in year \( t \)  
- \( r \) = discount rate (WACC)  
- \( C_0 \) = initial investment  


---

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- **Definition:** The discount rate that makes the project’s NPV equal to 0.  
- **Decision Rule:** Accept the project if IRR > cost of capital.  

$$
0 = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + IRR)^t} - C_0
$$  


---

## Real Options
- **Definition:** Managerial flexibility that allows decision-makers to influence cash flows by altering decisions during a project’s life.  
- **Types of Real Options:**
  - Investment Timing Option  
  - Abandonment/Shutdown Option  
  - Growth/Expansion Option  
  - Flexibility Option  


---

## Example — Investment Timing Option
If waiting provides new information about future cash flows, the expected NPV today is:  

$$
E(NPV_{today}) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i \cdot NPV_i }{(1 + r)}
$$  

Where:  

- \( p_i \) = probability of scenario \( i \)  
- \( NPV_i \) = NPV in that scenario  


---

## Example — Abandonment Option
Expected NPV with abandonment:  

$$
E(NPV) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i \cdot NPV_i
$$  

---

## Example — Growth Option
When a project creates potential for future opportunities:  

$$
E(NPV) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i \cdot NPV_i
$$  

Where the decision to pursue future opportunities depends on whether their NPV > 0.

## Key Insights
- Delaying projects can increase value when volatility is high.  
- Abandonment reduces downside risk.  
- Growth options add upside potential.  
- Flexibility has value when market conditions change.
