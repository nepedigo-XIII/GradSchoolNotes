## Shift in Perspective

Traditional view:  
Securities were seen primarily as a **source of funds**.  

Modern view:  
Securities are a **means to deploy and grow capital**.

## Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)

### Definition
The EMH proposes that **asset prices fully reflect all available information**.

If markets are efficient, it is impossible to consistently achieve returns higher than average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

---

## The Three Forms of Market Efficiency

| Type | Description | Implication |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Weak Form** | Past prices and returns do not predict future prices. | Technical or chart-based analysis doesn’t work. |
| **Semi-Strong Form** | All publicly available information is reflected in prices. | Fundamental analysis does not lead to consistent outperformance. |
| **Strong Form** | All information, both public and private, is reflected in prices. | Even insider information cannot generate abnormal profits. |

**Consensus:**  
Most academics and practitioners agree that markets are **semi-strong efficient**.

---

## How EMH Works

Suppose an asset worth \$100 trades for \$90.  
Arbitrageurs will buy the asset, driving the price up until it reaches \$100 again.

Result:  
No more mispricing — markets correct themselves.

---

### The Twenty-Dollar Bill Joke

> “If there was a \$20 bill on the ground, someone would have already picked it up.”

This illustrates the idea that **profitable opportunities are quickly exploited** in efficient markets.

---

## Implications for Actively Managed Funds

- Actively managed funds **cannot consistently beat the market**.  
- Empirical evidence shows that they **underperform, on average, by their fee amounts**.  
- Even if markets aren’t perfectly efficient, the **zero-sum game** effect ensures that not all managers can win.

---

## The Zero-Sum Game

Imagine all equities are held by active funds.

Whenever one fund outperforms the market, another must underperform.

- **EMH View:** No one can *consistently* outperform.  
- **Zero-Sum View:** Some can outperform, but only if others lose.

---

## Empirical Evidence

Studies consistently show that:
- Actively managed mutual funds **underperform passive benchmarks** after accounting for fees.  
- Persistence in outperformance is rare.

---

## Implications and Alternatives

### Practical Strategies
1. **Invest in low-cost passive funds.**  
2. **Two-Fund Separation (CAPM):**  
   Every investor can hold a mix of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio to achieve desired risk/return.

3. **Avoid insider trading.**  
   It’s illegal and prosecuted.

4. **Factor-based investing:**  
   Attempting to identify characteristics (factors) associated with higher returns.

5. **Incremental approaches:**  
   Examples include:
   - DFA and Vanguard strategies  
   - Exclude consistent underperformers  
   - Make money lending holdings for short positions  

---

## Performance Measurement

### 1. Raw Returns
The simplest performance measure:

$$
\text{Raw Return} = \frac{\text{Ending Value} - \text{Beginning Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}
$$

For multiple assets, the return is **weighted by portfolio allocations**.

**Example:**  
If you invest half in AAPL and half in TSLA, compute the weighted average of their returns.

---

### 2. Benchmarking

Evaluates performance relative to a **reference index**, e.g., S&P 500.  
Benchmarks help determine whether outperformance is due to **manager skill or market movement**.

**Challenges:**
- Selecting an appropriate benchmark  
- Benchmark “gaming” (choosing after-the-fact favorable comparisons)

---

### 3. Alpha (α)

From the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):**

$$
R_i - R_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) + \epsilon_i
$$

Where:
- \( R_i \): Return on the asset or fund  
- \( R_f \): Risk-free rate  
- \( R_m \): Market return  
- \( \alpha_i \): Alpha, or excess return unexplained by market risk  
- \( \epsilon_i \): Random error term  

If \( \alpha_i > 0 \), the investment **outperformed expectations**.  
If \( \alpha_i < 0 \), it **underperformed**.

---

### 4. Sharpe Ratio

Adjusts returns for risk:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E[R_p - R_f]}{\sigma_p}
$$

Where:
- \( E[R_p - R_f] \) = Expected excess return  
- \( \sigma_p \) = Standard deviation of portfolio returns  

**Example:**
If annual excess return = 6% and standard deviation = 15%,

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.40
$$

For markets, the Sharpe Ratio is typically **0.3–0.4** for annual data.

## Factor-Based Investing

### Historical Timeline
- **1950s–1970s:** CAPM and Efficient Market Theory  
- **1980s:** Recognition of CAPM’s limitations  
- **1990s–2000s:** Rise of **factor models** (e.g., Fama-French)  
- **2010s:** The “Factor Zoo” — proliferation of identified factors  

### Common Factors

| Factor | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Market Beta (β)** | Sensitivity to overall market movements |
| **Size** | Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks |
| **Value** | Low price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-book (P/B) ratios outperform high ones |
| **Momentum** | Stocks with recent strong performance tend to continue outperforming |
| **Quality** | Firms with consistent and growing earnings perform better |

---

## Example: Equities Lab

Creating a factor-based strategy:

**Filter Criteria:**
- Exclude **microcaps** (Market Cap > \$50M)  
- Exclude **penny stocks** (Price > \$5)  

**Then Test:**  
Apply filters for:
- Size  
- Value  
- Momentum  
- Quality  

Observe performance over time and compare factor impacts.

## Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Core Idea |
|----------|------------|
| **EMH** | Prices reflect all available information; consistent alpha is unlikely. |
| **Actively Managed Funds** | Underperform on average after fees. |
| **Zero-Sum Game** | Not everyone can beat the market simultaneously. |
| **Performance Metrics** | Raw returns, Alpha, Sharpe ratio. |
| **Factor Investing** | Uses quantifiable traits (e.g., size, value) to explain returns. |
| **Practical Takeaway** | Invest cheaply, diversify, and avoid overconfidence. |
