# Corporate Objectives and Governance

---

## Objectives of the Owner-Manager
- Maximize "utility," which may include:
  - Profits / Wealth  
  - Leisure time  
  - Employee welfare  
  - Community / Environmental interests  

- **Discounting:**  
  Owner-managers discount cash flows at their *personal rate*.

- **Risk:**  
  Firm risk = personal risk.  

- **Capital Constraints:**  
  Capital-constrained managers may sacrifice long-term cash flow for short-term gains.

---

## Financial Objectives of the Public Corporation
- Separation of ownership and management: Manager ≠ Owner.
- **Primary Objective:**  
  Maximization of **shareholder wealth**.
- Manager’s leisure or prestige only matters if it supports **share price**.
- Other objectives (EPS growth, market share, etc.) should not override shareholder wealth maximization.
- Many times, other objectives are inconsistent with maximizing shareholder wealth.

---

## Market Share vs. Stock Price
- The goal is **value creation**, not just size.  
- Trade-offs:
  - Returning money to shareholders (dividends, buybacks) vs. reinvesting.
  - **Losing money cannot be compensated by higher volume.**
- **Brand and Monopoly Power:**  
  - Market share may justify short-term losses if it leads to long-term monopoly pricing power.  

---

## Why Don’t EPS and Stock Price Always Align?

### Risk Considerations
- **Stock Price depends on cash flow**, not just earnings.  
- Shareholders care about both **risk and return**.  
- Example:  
  - A policy may increase EPS/ROE **but also risk**, lowering stock price.  
  - Conversely, a policy may reduce EPS/ROE **but lower risk**, increasing stock price.  

**Objective:** Get above the *risk-return line*.

---

### Growth Considerations
- Policies that increase **short-term EPS** may reduce stock price if they harm long-term growth.
- Conversely, policies that reduce short-term EPS may raise stock price if they support long-term growth.
- Market focus depends on **EPS forecasts** and **post-forecast performance**.

---

## Corporate Value vs. Stock Price
- **Asymmetric Information:**  
  - Things may look good internally but outsiders don’t see it.  
  - Or, things may look bad internally but outsiders think it’s fine.  

- **Implications:**  
  - Importance of communication and credibility.  
  - Role of compensation and governance in aligning interests.

---

## Non-Financial Objectives
- Companies may also consider:
  - Employees  
  - Community  
  - Environment  

- Shareholder interests ≠ Stakeholder interests.  
- Sometimes **stakeholder welfare aligns** with shareholder value (e.g., employee satisfaction → productivity).  

---

### Corporation as a Nexus of Contracts
- Stakeholders protect themselves via explicit or implicit contracts:
  - Labor: wages, working conditions, severance.  
  - Customers: pricing, service, warranties.  
  - Creditors: interest rates, covenants.  

- If firms ignore stakeholders, **society pushes back**:
  - Lawsuits (e.g., pollution).  
  - Regulation (e.g., mortgage modification laws).

---

### Conflict of Objectives
- Financial vs. Non-financial objectives may **conflict**.
- Different schools of thought exist.  

**Class Assumption:**  
- If “doing good” maximizes shareholder wealth → do it.  
- Otherwise, treat it as a **spectrum** between profit maximization and broader social responsibility.

---

## Stakeholder Approach
- Broader view: considers **all affected parties**:
  - Shareholders  
  - Employees  
  - Society in general  
  - Possibly even competitors  

---

## Motivating People in Firms
- Problem: How to get people to maximize shareholder wealth?  
- Tools:
  - **Carrots** → compensation, incentives  
  - **Sticks** → oversight, penalties  

- Reading: *Drive* by Daniel Pink.  

---

## Solutions: Corporate Governance
- **Carrots:**  
  - Compensation contracts  
  - Ownership stakes  

- **Sticks:**  
  - Internal pressure (Board, shareholders)  
  - External pressure (hostile takeovers, regulators, media, criminal penalties)  

---

## Compensation Types & Problems
- **Salary:** little incentive to work hard.  
- **Options:** risk-taking when out of the money.  
- **Renegotiation:** reduces credibility.  
- **Restricted Stock:** no diversification, major risk if firm fails.  
- **Bonuses:** may reward luck, not skill.  

---

## Importance of Corporate Governance
- **Trust and reliable information** are essential to capitalism.  
- Markets and contracts evolve to solve agency problems.  
- Legal/regulatory system matters.  
- **Cross-country differences:**  
  - Weak law enforcement → more family-owned firms.  

---

## Concluding Thoughts
- **Agency problems** are central to corporate finance.  
- Markets, contracts, and governance evolve to mitigate these problems.  
- Legal, political, and regulatory systems shape the “rules of the game.”
