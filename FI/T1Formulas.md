### 1. Bond Price

$$
P = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{F}{(1+y)^T}
$$

- $P$ = Price of the bond  
- $C$ = Annual coupon payment $ (F \cdot c) $  
- $F$ = Face value of bond  
- $c$ = Coupon rate  
- $y$ = Yield to maturity (YTM) per period  
- $T$ = Number of periods to maturity  

---

### 2. Yield to Maturity (Approximation)

$$
y \approx \frac{C + \frac{F - P}{T}}{\frac{F + P}{2}}
$$

- $y$ = Approximate yield to maturity  
- $C$ = Coupon payment  
- $F$ = Face value of bond  
- $P$ = Price of the bond  
- $T$ = Number of periods to maturity  

---

### 3. Net Present Value (NPV)

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} - C_0
$$

- $CF_t$ = Cash flow at time $ t $  
- $r$ = Discount rate  
- $C_0$ = Initial investment (outflow)  
- $n$ = Number of periods  

---

### 4. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Defined as the discount rate that makes NPV = 0:

$$
0 = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+IRR)^t} - C_0
$$

- $CF_t$ = Cash flow at time $ t $  
- $IRR$ = Internal Rate of Return  
- $C_0$ = Initial investment  
- $n$ = Number of periods  

---

### 5. Profitability Index (PI)

$$
PI = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}}{C_0}
$$

- $PI$ = Profitability index  
- $CF_t$ = Cash flow at time $ t $  
- $r$ = Discount rate  
- $C_0$ = Initial investment  
- $n$ = Number of periods  

---

### 6. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

$$
WACC = \frac{E}{V} \cdot R_e + \frac{D}{V} \cdot R_d \cdot (1-T_c)
$$

- $E$ = Market value of equity  
- $D$ = Market value of debt  
- $V = E + D$ = Total firm value  
- $R_e$ = Cost of equity  
- $R_d$ = Cost of debt  
- $T_c$ = Corporate tax rate  

---

### 7. Macaulay Duration

$$
D = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \frac{t \cdot CF_t}{(1+y)^t} \right)}{P}
$$

- $D$ = Macaulay duration  
- $CF_t$ = Cash flow at time $ t $  
- $y$ = Yield per period  
- $P$ = Price of the bond  
- $T$ = Number of periods to maturity  

---

### 8. Risk-Free Rate (Rearranged CAPM)

From CAPM:

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
$$

Rearranged (using Market Risk Premium, $ MRP $):

$$
R_f = E(R_i) - \beta_i \cdot MRP
$$

- $R_f$ = Risk-free rate  
- $E(R_i)$ = Expected return of asset $ i $  
- $\beta_i$ = Beta of asset $ i $  
- $E(R_m)$ = Expected market return  
- $MRP = E(R_m) - R_f$ = Market risk premium  

---

### 9. Bond Coupon Cashflows (Discounted)

For year $ t $:

$$
DCF_t = \frac{C}{(1+y)^t}
$$

At maturity year $ T $:

$$
DCF_T = \frac{C + F}{(1+y)^T}
$$

- $DCF_t$ = Discounted cash flow at time $ t $  
- $C$ = Coupon payment  
- $y$ = Yield per period  
- $F$ = Face value of bond (principal)  
- $T$ = Number of periods to maturity  

---

### 10. Cost of Equity (CAPM)

$$
R_e = R_f + \beta \cdot (E(R_m) - R_f)
$$

Or equivalently, using Market Risk Premium:

$$
R_e = R_f + \beta \cdot MRP
$$

- $R_e$ = Cost of equity  
- $R_f$ = Risk-free rate  
- $\beta$ = Beta of the company  
- $E(R_m)$ = Expected return on the market  
- $MRP = E(R_m) - R_f$ = Market risk premium
