# WACC, Leverage  
**Sugata Ray**

## Effects of having both Debt and Equity  
**WACC + NPV**

### Gameplan
- Recall that we studied two ways to finance our firm – **Debt** and **Equity**  
- The **weighted average cost of capital (WACC)** is the average cost of the money the firm is using  
- Money has a cost? Isn’t the idea of business to use money to make more money?  

---

## The Problem with “Business = Using Money to Make More Money”
- Necessary but insufficient condition. Why?  
- Money can *always* be used to make more money (e.g. 1% CD rate)  
- **Risk considerations**  
- **Other opportunities**  
- **Cost of capital** ties all these things together → minimum return required  

---

## WACC Concept
- Average of the cost of all the sources of capital  
- For most firms:  
  - **Cost of equity capital**  
  - **Cost of debt capital**  
- Weighted by their proportion in the firm’s capital structure  

---

## WACC – No Taxes
$$
WACC = w_d r_d + w_e r_e
$$
- $w$ = weights of debt/equity in capital structure  
- $r$ = cost of each component  

Example: in a 50/50 equity–debt firm, $w_e = w_d = 0.5$

---

## WACC – With Taxes (Interest Deductible)
$$
WACC = w_d r_d (1-T) + w_e r_e
$$

- Example: $T = 30\%$, $r_e = 10\%$, $r_d = 10\%$  
  - $100 equity \Rightarrow$ $10$ payout post-tax  
  - $100 debt \Rightarrow$ $10$ payout pre-tax = $7$ post-tax  

---

## Capital Structure Weights
- **Market values** are correct (not book values).  
- Equity: easy to calculate for public firms.  
- Debt: harder but possible (Bloomberg, Morningstar, quotes).  
- Book values may approximate, but beware effects of interest rate changes and distress.

---

## Cost of Debt
**Standard approach:** Yield to Maturity (YTM) on long-term option-free debt.

- **YTM refresher:** discount rate that makes PV of bond payments = price  

### Why not use coupon rate?  
- Ignores interest rate changes, credit considerations  

### Why not interest paid / debt outstanding?  
- New debt raised during year  
- Stale book values  

---

## Complications in Cost of Debt
- Floating rate debt  
- Convertible debt (lower YTM ≠ cheaper)  
- Foreign currency debt  
- Promised vs. expected rate (esp. below-investment grade)  
- Term structure of YTMs  

---

## Cost of Equity
Use **CAPM**:
$$
r_e = r_f + \beta (r_m - r_f)
$$

- $r_f$ = risk-free rate (e.g. T-bills)  
- $\beta$ = sensitivity to market  
- $r_m$ = expected market return  

---

### Why Is There a Cost for Retained Earnings?
- Earnings can be reinvested or paid out as dividends  
- If retained, investors lose opportunity to invest elsewhere and earn $r_e$  
- Alternative: repurchase stock and still earn $r_e$  

---

### Why Is New Common Stock More Expensive?
- Flotation costs (underwriting fees)  
- Negative signal to capital markets → depresses stock price  

---

## Tax Rate Considerations
- **Average effective tax rate** (easy)  
- **Corporate statutory tax rate** (simple, less accurate)  
- **Marginal tax rate** (better, harder)  
- **Projected future tax rate** (best, hardest)  

---

## WACC Formula Recap
$$
WACC = w_d r_d (1-T) + w_e r_e
$$

- Used as the firm’s **hurdle rate** for typical projects  
- Not for large bespoke projects with unique financing  

---

## What If Returns < WACC?
- **Short run:** no issue (covering expenses, no bankruptcy)  
- **Long run:** investors leave → share price falls → harder to raise capital  

---

## Objective of Corporate Finance
- Minimize WACC by choosing financing carefully  

---

## Debt vs Equity
- More debt → larger tax shield → higher firm value  
- But too much debt → distress & bankruptcy costs outweigh benefits  

---

## Business Risk vs Financial Risk
- **Business risk:** competition, product liability, operating leverage  
- **Financial risk:** depends only on financing mix (more debt = more concentrated risk for equityholders)  

---

## Example: No Leverage
- Invest $100,000 equity in 1 apartment building  
- 1 year later:  
  - Market good (50%): worth $150,000  
  - Market bad (50%): worth $90,000  
- Expected value: $120,000  
- Expected return: $(120,000/100,000) - 1 = 20\%$  

---

## Example: Leveraged
- Buy 10 buildings = $1,000,000$  
  - Equity = $100,000$  
  - Debt = $900,000$ (10% loan)  

### Outcomes:
- Assets: $1,500,000$ → Equity payoff = $510,000$ → 110% return  
- Assets: $900,000$ → Equity payoff = $-90,000$ → -90% return  

Leverage amplifies both return **and** risk.  

---

## Does Capital Structure Matter?
- If one owner holds all debt + equity, with no taxes/bankruptcy:  
  - Total payoff = $(R - C)(1-T)$  
- With debt, total payout = Dividends + Interest  
- Taxes make debt favorable (interest deductible), but bankruptcy costs offset  

---

## Taxes and Bankruptcy
- Interest is deductible:  
  - $D+I = (R-C)(1-T)$ with no debt  
  - $D+I = (R-C)$ with all debt  
- More debt → higher payout until bankruptcy risk grows
