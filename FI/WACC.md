# WACC, Leverage  
**Sugata Ray**

---

## Effects of having both Debt and Equity  
**WACC + NPV**

### Gameplan
- Recall that we studied two ways to finance our firm – **Debt** and **Equity**  
- The **weighted average cost of capital (WACC)** is the average cost of the money the firm is using  
- Money has a cost? Isn’t the idea of business to use money to make more money?  

---

## The Problem with “Business = Using Money to Make More Money”
- Necessary but insufficient condition. Why?  
- Money can *always* be used to make more money (e.g. 1% CD rate)  
- **Risk considerations**  
- **Other opportunities**  
- **Cost of capital** ties all these things together → minimum return required  

---

## WACC Concept
- Average of the cost of all the sources of capital  
- For most firms:  
  - **Cost of equity capital**  
  - **Cost of debt capital**  
- Weighted by their proportion in the firm’s capital structure  
- Used as the firm’s **hurdle rate** for typical projects, returns should exceed WACC, otherwise capital is better off elsewhere 

---

## WACC – No Taxes
$$
WACC = w_d r_d + w_e r_e
$$
- $w$ = weights of debt/equity in capital structure  
- $r$ = cost of each component  

Example: in a 50/50 equity–debt firm, $w_e = w_d = 0.5$

---

## WACC – With Taxes (Interest Deductible)
$$
WACC = w_d r_d (1-T) + w_e r_e
$$

- Example: $T = 30\%$, $r_e = 10\%$, $r_d = 10\%$  
  - $100 equity \Rightarrow$ $10$ payout post-tax  
  - $100 debt \Rightarrow$ $10$ payout pre-tax = $7$ post-tax  

---

## Capital Structure Weights
- **Market values** are correct (not book values).  
- Equity: easy to calculate for public firms.  
- Debt: harder but possible (Bloomberg, Morningstar, quotes).  
- Book values may approximate, but beware effects of interest rate changes and distress.

---

## Cost of Debt
**Standard approach:** Yield to Maturity (YTM) on long-term option-free debt.

- **YTM refresher:** discount rate that makes PV of bond payments = price  

### Why not use coupon rate?  
- Ignores interest rate changes, credit considerations  

### Why not interest paid / debt outstanding?  
- New debt raised during year  
- Stale book values  

---

## Complications in Cost of Debt
- Floating rate debt  
- Convertible debt (lower YTM ≠ cheaper)  
- Foreign currency debt  
- Promised vs. expected rate (esp. below-investment grade)  
- Term structure of YTMs  

---

## Cost of Equity
Use **CAPM**:

$$
r_e = r_f + \beta (r_m - r_f)
$$

- $r_f$ = risk-free rate (e.g. T-bills)  
- $\beta$ = sensitivity to market  
- $r_m$ = expected market return  

---

### Why Is There a Cost for Retained Earnings?
- Earnings can be reinvested or paid out as dividends  
- If retained, investors lose opportunity to invest elsewhere and earn $r_e$  
- Alternative: repurchase stock and still earn $r_e$  

---

### Why Is New Common Stock More Expensive?
- Flotation costs (underwriting fees)  
- Negative signal to capital markets → depresses stock price  

---

## Tax Rate Considerations
- **Average effective tax rate** (easy)  
- **Corporate statutory tax rate** (simple, less accurate)  
- **Marginal tax rate** (better, harder)  
- **Projected future tax rate** (best, hardest)  

---

## WACC Formula Recap
$$
WACC = w_d r_d (1-T) + w_e r_e
$$

- Used as the firm’s **hurdle rate** for typical projects  
- Not for large bespoke projects with unique financing  

---

## What If Returns < WACC?
- **Short run:** no issue (covering expenses, no bankruptcy)  
- **Long run:** investors leave → share price falls → harder to raise capital  

---

## Objective of Corporate Finance
- Minimize WACC by choosing financing carefully  

---

## Debt vs Equity
- More debt → larger tax shield → higher firm value  
- But too much debt → distress & bankruptcy costs outweigh benefits  

---

## Business Risk vs Financial Risk
- **Business risk:** competition, product liability, operating leverage  
- **Financial risk:** depends only on financing mix (more debt = more concentrated risk for equityholders)  

Leverage amplifies the expected return and expected risk to shareholders, which if they are now also the decision makers for the firm, increases their stake in the game, incentivizes them to work harder, and thus increases firm value.

## Example: No Leverage
- Invest $100,000 equity in 1 apartment building  
- 1 year later:  
  - Market good (50%): worth $150,000  
  - Market bad (50%): worth $90,000  
- Expected value: $120,000  
- Expected return: $(120,000/100,000) - 1 = 20\%$  

---

## Example: Leveraged
- Buy 10 buildings = $1,000,000$  
  - Equity = $100,000$  
  - Debt = $900,000$ (10% loan)  

### Outcomes:
- Assets: $1,500,000$ → Equity payoff = $510,000$ → 110% return  
- Assets: $900,000$ → Equity payoff = $-90,000$ → -90% return  

Leverage amplifies both return **and** risk.  

---

## Does Capital Structure Matter?
- If one owner holds all debt + equity, with no taxes/bankruptcy:  
  - Total payoff = $(R - C)(1-T)$  
- With debt, total payout = Dividends + Interest  
- Taxes make debt favorable (interest deductible), but bankruptcy costs offset  

---

## Taxes and Bankruptcy
- Interest is deductible:  
  - $D+I = (R-C)(1-T)$ with no debt  
  - $D+I = (R-C)$ with all debt  
- More debt → higher payout until bankruptcy risk grows
