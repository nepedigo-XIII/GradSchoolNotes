# Chapter 14 – Resource Planning (Study Guide)

## Learning Objectives
- Define **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**  
- Review ERP benefits and costs  
- Understand **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**  
- Demonstrate how MRP works  
- Explain **Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP)**

## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Software for organizing and managing business processes.  
- **Modules share information** across business functions using a common database.  
- Example: customer sales data shared with supply chain for global replenishment.

### ERP Modules (4 Categories)
1. **Finance & Accounting**  
   - Investment, cost, asset, capital, debt management  
   - Budgets, profitability, performance reports  

2. **Sales & Marketing**  
   - Pricing, availability, orders, shipments, billing  
   - Customer complaints, product registration  

3. **Production & Materials Management**  
   - Process planning, BOM, costing, MRP, scheduling  
   - Purchase orders, inventory  

4. **Human Resources**  
   - Workforce planning, payroll, benefits  
   - Org charts

## Material Planning Systems, Legacy IBM Example
- **MRP**: Translates a master schedule of final products into time-phased net requirements for assemblies, subassemblies, and parts.  
- **MRP II**: Expanded 1970s systems that plan and execute all internal functions.

### MRP Process
- Uses **backward scheduling** to calculate when & how much to order.  
- **Modules**:
  - **MPS** (Master Production Schedule): Authorized schedule  
  - **BOM** (Bill of Materials): Product structure for each product  
  - **CRP** (Capacity Requirements Planning): Checks workload feasibility  

**MRP Output**: Schedules for internal activities + supply chain orders.

---

## Objectives of MRP
- Determine **quantity** and **timing** of material requirements.  
- Determine:
  - **What to order** (via BOM)  
  - **How much to order** (lot-sizing rules)  
  - **When to order** (apply lead times)  
  - **When to schedule delivery**  
- Keep priorities updated in a changing environment.

---

## Demand Types
- **Independent Demand**: Demand for finished products; must be forecasted.  
- **Dependent Demand**: Derived demand for components based on finished goods; managed by MRP.

---

## Inputs to MRP
1. **Authorized MPS**: What & when to build.  
2. **Inventory Records**: On-hand inventory and replenishment needs.  
3. **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: Recipe of parts for one finished product; usually an indented parent–child structure. (Changes via ECN.)

---

## Lot-Size Rules
- **FOQ (Fixed-Order Quantity)**: Same quantity every order.  
- **L4L (Lot-for-Lot)**: Order exactly what's needed for the period — minimizes inventory, maximizes orders.  
- **POQ (Period-Order Quantity)**: Order enough to cover next *n* periods.

---

## Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP)
- Verifies feasibility of MRP schedules.  
- **RCCP (Rough-Cut Capacity Planning)**: High-level feasibility check.  
- Uses **open shop orders** and **planned shop orders** to calculate workloads by work center and time period.

### Available Capacity (display formula)
$$
\text{Available Capacity} = (\text{Machines}) \times (\text{Shifts}) \times (\text{Hours/Shift}) \times (\text{Days/Week}) \times (\text{Utilization}) \times (\text{Efficiency})
$$


---

## Resource Planning Across the Organization
- **Accounting**: Tracks future material commitments from MRP outputs.  
- **Marketing**: Uses the MPS to watch for shortages.  
- **Information Systems**: Maintains MRP and MPS data.  
- **Purchasing**: Plans contracts and deliveries.  
- **Manufacturing**: Develops daily schedules and shop workloads.

---

## Key Takeaways
- MRP consists of three critical steps:  
  1. **Netting** (subtract inventory on hand from gross requirements)  
  2. **BOM Explosion** (translate parent requirements into component needs)  
  3. **Time Phasing** (apply lead times to determine order/release dates)  
- Inputs must be accurate: feasible MPS, correct BOM, accurate inventory records.

---

## Quick Formulas (display math)
**Order timing (when to place the order):**


$$
\text{Order Date} = \text{Need Date} - \text{Lead Time}
$$

**Available capacity (repeated):**


$$
\text{Capacity} = M \times S \times H \times D \times U \times E
$$

where  
- $M$ = number of machines  
- $S$ = shifts  
- $H$ = hours per shift  
- $D$ = days per week  
- $U$ = utilization (fraction)  
- $E$ = efficiency (fraction)

## Practice offer
If you'd like, I can **add a worked MRP explosion example** (CD cabinet) as a numerical, step-by-step markdown section ready for your notebook — I can include tables rendered as markdown so you can paste them directly. Would you like that added now?
