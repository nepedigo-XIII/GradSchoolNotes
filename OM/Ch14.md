## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Software for organizing and managing business processes.  
- **Modules share information** across business functions using a common database.  
- Example: customer sales data shared with supply chain for global replenishment.

### ERP Modules (4 Categories)
1. **Finance & Accounting**  
   - Investment, cost, asset, capital, debt management  
   - Budgets, profitability, performance reports  

2. **Sales & Marketing**  
   - Pricing, availability, orders, shipments, billing  
   - Customer complaints, product registration  

3. **Production & Materials Management**  
   - Process planning, BOM, costing, MRP, scheduling  
   - Purchase orders, inventory  

4. **Human Resources**  
   - Workforce planning, payroll, benefits  
   - Org charts

## Material Planning Systems, Legacy IBM Example
- **MRP**: Translates a master schedule of final products into time-phased net requirements for assemblies, subassemblies, and parts.  
- **MRP II**: Expanded 1970s systems that plan and execute all internal functions.

### MRP Process
- Uses **backward scheduling** to calculate when & how much to order.  
- **Modules**:
  - **MPS** (Master Production Schedule): Authorized schedule  
  - **BOM** (Bill of Materials): Product structure for each product  
  - **CRP** (Capacity Requirements Planning): Checks workload feasibility  

**MRP Output**: Schedules for internal activities + supply chain orders.

---

## Objectives of MRP
- Determine **quantity** and **timing** of material requirements.  
- Determine:
  - **What to order** (via BOM)  
  - **How much to order** (lot-sizing rules)  
  - **When to order** (apply lead times)  
  - **When to schedule delivery**  
- Keep priorities updated in a changing environment.

---

## Demand Types
- **Independent Demand**: Demand for finished products; must be forecasted.  
- **Dependent Demand**: Derived demand for components based on finished goods; managed by MRP.

---

## Inputs to MRP
1. **Authorized MPS**: What & when to build.  
2. **Inventory Records**: On-hand inventory and replenishment needs.  
3. **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: Recipe of parts for one finished product; usually an indented parent–child structure. (Changes via ECN.)

---

## Lot-Size Rules
- **FOQ (Fixed-Order Quantity)**: Same quantity every order.  
- **L4L (Lot-for-Lot)**: Order exactly what's needed for the period — minimizes inventory, maximizes orders.  
- **POQ (Period-Order Quantity)**: Order enough to cover next *n* periods.

---

## Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP)
- Verifies feasibility of MRP schedules.  
- **RCCP (Rough-Cut Capacity Planning)**: High-level feasibility check.  
- Uses **open shop orders** and **planned shop orders** to calculate workloads by work center and time period.

### Available Capacity (display formula)
$$
\text{Available Capacity} = (\text{Machines}) \times (\text{Shifts}) \times (\text{Hours/Shift}) \times (\text{Days/Week}) \times (\text{Utilization}) \times (\text{Efficiency})
$$


---

## Resource Planning Across the Organization
- **Accounting**: Tracks future material commitments from MRP outputs.  
- **Marketing**: Uses the MPS to watch for shortages.  
- **Information Systems**: Maintains MRP and MPS data.  
- **Purchasing**: Plans contracts and deliveries.  
- **Manufacturing**: Develops daily schedules and shop workloads.

---

## Key Takeaways
- MRP consists of three critical steps:  
  1. **Netting** (subtract inventory on hand from gross requirements)  
  2. **BOM Explosion** (translate parent requirements into component needs)  
  3. **Time Phasing** (apply lead times to determine order/release dates)  
- Inputs must be accurate: feasible MPS, correct BOM, accurate inventory records.

---

## Quick Formulas (display math)
**Order timing (when to place the order):**


$$
\text{Order Date} = \text{Need Date} - \text{Lead Time}
$$

**Available capacity (repeated):**


$$
\text{Capacity} = M \times S \times H \times D \times U \times E
$$

where  
- $M$ = number of machines  
- $S$ = shifts  
- $H$ = hours per shift  
- $D$ = days per week  
- $U$ = utilization (fraction)  
- $E$ = efficiency (fraction)

# Inventory Management

## Inventory Management Objectives

- **Maximize Customer Service**
  - Ensure that the right products are available at the right time in the right quantity.  
  - Reduces stockouts and backorders, leading to higher customer satisfaction.  
  - Achieved by maintaining appropriate stock levels and aligning with demand forecasts.  

- **Minimize Inventory Costs**
  - Inventory ties up capital and incurs multiple costs.  
  - The objective is to balance service levels against the cost of carrying excess stock.  
  - Involves optimizing reorder points, lot sizes, and lead times.  

- **Maximize Efficiency**
  - Efficient use of resources in procurement, storage, and distribution.  
  - Streamlines operations through technology, automation, and proper layout of warehouses.  
  - Reduces waste, improves cash flow, and ensures smooth production processes.

## Cost Types

- **Holding Costs (Carrying Costs)**  
  - Costs of storing inventory over time.  
  - Includes warehousing, insurance, depreciation, obsolescence, and opportunity cost of capital.  
  - Often expressed as a percentage of inventory value per year.  

- **Ordering Costs**  
  - Costs associated with placing and receiving inventory orders.  
  - Includes administrative expenses (paperwork, purchase order processing), shipping, and setup costs for production.  
  - Larger order quantities reduce ordering frequency, but increase holding costs.  

- **Shortage Costs (Stockout Costs)**  
  - Costs incurred when demand cannot be met from available inventory.  
  - Includes lost sales, backorder processing, expedited shipping, and potential loss of customer goodwill.  

- **Risk Costs**  
  - Risks tied to holding inventory, such as damage, theft, spoilage, and obsolescence (especially in technology or fashion industries).  
  - Can also include risks due to supplier disruptions or inaccurate demand forecasting.  

- **Storage Costs**  
  - Direct costs of physically holding inventory in a warehouse.  
  - Includes rent, utilities, equipment, security, and labor required for inventory handling.  
  - Sometimes grouped under holding costs, but often listed separately for clarity.

## ABC Analysis Steps

ABC analysis is a method of classifying inventory into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their relative importance, often measured by annual dollar usage.  

1. **Calculate Annual Dollar Usage for each Item**  
   - Formula:  

     $$
     \text{Annual Dollar Usage} = \text{Annual Demand (units)} \times \text{Unit Cost}
     $$ 

   - Identifies which items contribute most to total inventory value.  

2. **List Items in Descending Order based on Annual Dollar Usage**  
   - Rank all inventory items from highest to lowest total dollar usage.  
   - Highlights the items that consume the majority of investment.  

3. **Calculate the Cumulative Dollar Usage and Percentage**  
   - Compute the cumulative sum of dollar usage as you move down the list.  
   - Divide by total dollar usage to find cumulative percentages.  

4. **Classify Items into Categories (A, B, C)**  
   - **Category A**: High-value items (top ~70–80% of total dollar usage, usually 10–20% of items). Require tight control, accurate records, frequent review.  
   - **Category B**: Moderate-value items (next ~15–25% of total dollar usage, about 30% of items). Controlled with standard review policies.  
   - **Category C**: Low-value items (last ~5–10% of dollar usage, often 50%+ of items). Require simpler, less costly controls.

## Ordering Types

### Lot-for-Lot (L4L)
- **Definition**: Order exactly the amount needed for production or demand in each period, no more and no less.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimizes inventory holding costs (no excess stock carried).  
  - Simple to understand and implement.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High ordering costs due to frequent orders.  
  - Less favorable if order setup costs are significant.  
- **Best Use**: Items with highly variable demand, short shelf life, or when holding costs are high.  



### Fixed Order Quantity (FOQ)
- **Definition**: A predetermined order quantity is used every time inventory is replenished. Often calculated using formulas like EOQ (Economic Order Quantity).  
- **Advantages**:
  - Balances holding and ordering costs.  
  - Can take advantage of bulk discounts.  
  - Provides predictability in ordering and production schedules.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires accurate demand forecasts.  
  - Can result in overstocking or shortages if demand fluctuates significantly.  
- **Best Use**: Stable demand environments where economies of scale in ordering are beneficial.  


### Min-Max System
- **Definition**: Inventory is monitored between a **minimum level (reorder point)** and a **maximum level (target stock)**. When inventory falls below the minimum, an order is placed to bring stock up to the maximum.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Helps maintain safety stock while preventing overstock.  
  - Simple and flexible system, commonly used in retail.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires continuous monitoring or regular checks.  
  - If lead times vary, risk of stockouts increases.  
- **Best Use**: Items with moderately stable demand but where some fluctuation is expected.  



### Order n Periods (Fixed Period Ordering)
- **Definition**: Inventory is replenished to cover demand for a fixed number of future periods (n). For example, if n = 3, orders cover expected demand for the next 3 periods.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces the number of orders compared to Lot-for-Lot.  
  - Provides a balance between ordering frequency and holding costs.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires accurate forecasting of demand over the chosen period.  
  - May lead to excess inventory if demand falls unexpectedly.  
- **Best Use**: Environments with relatively predictable demand and stable lead times.
