---

## Learning Objectives

- Describe basic supply chains and supply chain management.  
- Explain issues affecting supply chain management.  
- Illustrate how sourcing decisions are made.  
- Describe the role of warehousing.  
- Describe how supply chain management is implemented.

---

## Basic Supply Chains

A **supply chain** is the network of all the activities involved in delivering a finished product or service to the customer.

Activities include:

- Sourcing of raw materials  
- Manufacturing & assembly  
- Warehousing  
- Order entry & tracking  
- Distribution & delivery  

**Supply Chain Management (SCM)** is the vital business function that coordinates and manages all the activities of the supply chain.  

It:
- Coordinates movement of goods from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors  
- Promotes information sharing (forecasts, sales data, promotions)

---

## Components of a Supply Chain for a Manufacturer

### External Suppliers
- **Tier One Supplier:** Supplies directly to the processor  
- **Tier Two Supplier:** Supplies to Tier One  
- **Tier Three Supplier:** Supplies to Tier Two  

### Internal Functions
- Processing  
- Purchasing  
- Planning  
- Quality  
- Shipping  

### External Distributors
Responsible for transporting finished products to appropriate locations.

**Logistics Managers** oversee:
- **Traffic Management:** Arranging shipments for incoming and outgoing materials  
- **Distribution Management:** Movement from manufacturer to customer  

---

## Supply Chain for a Service Organization

Service supply chains are similar to those of manufacturers.  
Integration of internal operations and coordination with external distributors is key.

---

## The Bullwhip Effect

**Definition:**  
The inaccurate or distorted demand information created within the supply chain.

### Causes:
- Demand forecasting updates  
- Order batching  
- Price fluctuations  
- Rationing and gaming  

### Effects:
- Excessive inventory investment  
- Poor customer service  
- Inefficient transportation  
- Misused manufacturing capacity  
- Lost revenues  

### Countermeasures:
- Share real demand information (e.g., POS data)  
- Eliminate order batching  
- Stabilize pricing  
- Eliminate gaming behaviors  

---

## Global Trends in SCM

### Key Influences:
1. **Consumer Expectations & Competition** – power has shifted to the consumer  
2. **Globalization** – firms capitalize on emerging markets  
3. **Government Regulations & E-Commerce** – influence Internet trade  
4. **Green SCM** – recycling, eco-efficiency, waste minimization  

---

## Global SCM Factors

Global supply chains face complications from:
- Infrastructure issues (transportation, communication, labor shortages)  
- Product proliferation (customization increases forecast inaccuracy)  
- **Supply Chain Velocity** – the speed at which products move from manufacturer to customer  

---

## Green Supply Chain Management

Focuses on the environmental impact of supply chain processes.  
Includes sustainable sourcing, recycling, and waste reduction.

---

## The Role of Purchasing

The **purchasing department** is responsible for:
- Selecting suppliers  
- Negotiating and administering contracts  
- Monitoring supplier performance  
- Placing orders  
- Developing supplier relations  
- Maintaining supplier ethics and responsibility  

**Material costs** often represent 50–60% of cost of goods sold, so purchasing plays a critical role.

---

## Sourcing Decisions

Firms decide which products to **produce in-house** vs. **outsource**.

- **Vertical Integration:** Extent of supply chain ownership  
- **Backward Integration:** Owning sources of raw materials/components  
- **Forward Integration:** Owning distribution channels  

### Insourcing vs. Outsourcing

Key questions:
- Is the technology critical to success?  
- Is it a core competency essential for survival?  

---

## Make or Buy Analysis

Compare total costs of **insourcing (make)** vs. **outsourcing (buy):**

$$
TC_{make} = FC_{make} + VC_{make} \times Q
$$

$$
TC_{buy} = FC_{buy} + VC_{buy} \times Q
$$

At the **indifference point**, total costs are equal:

$$
FC_{make} + VC_{make}Q = FC_{buy} + VC_{buy}Q
$$

Solving for \( Q \):

$$
Q_{indifference} = \frac{FC_{make} - FC_{buy}}{VC_{buy} - VC_{make}}
$$

---

### Example

**Scenario:**  
Mary and Sue open a bagel shop.

- **Buy option:**  
  - Fixed cost: \$1,000/year  
  - Variable cost: \$0.40 per bagel  
- **Make option:**  
  - Fixed cost: \$15,000/year  
  - Variable cost: \$0.15 per bagel  
- **Expected sales:** 60,000 bagels  

Compute \( Q_{indifference} \) to determine which is cheaper.

---

## Developing Supplier Relationships

Top three selection criteria:
1. Price  
2. Quality  
3. On-time delivery  

**Note:** Supplier choice must align with company mission.

### Critical Partnership Factors:
- **Impact:** Productivity and competitiveness beyond normal levels  
- **Intimacy:** Trust and close working relationship  
- **Vision:** Shared mission and commitment  

### Win-Win Partnerships:
**Characteristics:**
- Long-term & strategic  
- Share information, risks, and plans  
- Driven by customer expectations  

**Benefits:**
- Early Supplier Involvement (ESI)  
- Shorter time-to-market  
- Cost and process improvements  

---

## The Role of Warehouses

Types:
- **Plant warehouses**
- **Regional warehouses**
- **Local warehouses**

### Functions:
1. **Transportation Consolidation:** Combine LTL into TL shipments  
2. **Product Mixing:** Group various products for direct shipment  
3. **Customer Services:** Improve service via proximity and replenishment speed  

### Cross-Docking
Eliminates storage and order-picking while maintaining receiving and shipping.

**Success Factors:**
- Reduced capital investment  
- Lower inventory & personnel costs  
- Shorter order cycle time  
- Fewer damaged goods  
- Reduced freight costs  

**Failure Causes:**
- Poor facility layout  
- Non-integrated systems  
- Unreliable suppliers  
- Low volume or poor compliance  

---

## Integrated SCM

Implementation Steps:
1. Analyze entire supply chain  
2. Integrate **internal functions** first  
3. Form **partnerships** with external suppliers  

### Goals

**Supplier’s Goals:**
- Increase sales volume  
- Improve customer loyalty  
- Reduce cost & improve profitability  

**Manufacturer’s Goals:**
- Reduce duplication and lead times  
- Improve quality  
- Involve suppliers early  
- Speed up time-to-market  

---

## Leveraging SCM

- Assess supply chain network regularly  
- Maintain global demand visibility  
- Improve asset productivity  
- Expand tracking and visibility  
- Design for delivery and continuous improvement  

---

## Supply Chain Performance Metrics

**Traditional Measures:**
- Return on Investment (ROI)  
- Profitability  
- Market Share  
- Revenue Growth  

**Additional Measures:**
- Customer service levels  
- Inventory turns  
- Weeks of supply  
- Inventory obsolescence  

---

## SCM Across the Organization

SCM impacts all departments:

- **Accounting:** Lower inventory levels  
- **Marketing:** Improved customer service (POS data)  
- **Information Systems:** Enable data sharing (EDI, RFID, Internet)  
- **Purchasing:** Material sourcing  
- **Operations:** Better production planning
