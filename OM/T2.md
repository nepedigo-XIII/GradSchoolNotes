# **Chapter 4 – Supply Chain Management (SCM)**

## **1. What is a Supply Chain?**
Network of all activities involved in delivering a product/service:
- Raw material sourcing
- Manufacturing and assembly
- Warehousing
- Order processing
- Distribution
- Delivery

## **2. Supply Chain Management**
Coordinating movement of materials, information, and finances across the chain.

Key functions:
- Information sharing (forecasts, sales)
- Coordinated production and delivery
- Managing suppliers & distributors

## **3. Components of a Manufacturing Supply Chain**
### **External Suppliers**
- **Tier 1** → Direct to manufacturer  
- **Tier 2** → Supplies to Tier 1  
- **Tier 3** → Supplies to Tier 2  

### **Internal Functions**
- Purchasing  
- Planning  
- Quality  
- Operations  
- Shipping  

### **External Distributors**
Responsible for transportation and final delivery.

## **4. The Bullwhip Effect**
Distorted/delayed demand information that increases variability up the chain.

### Causes:

Material cost = **50–60%** of cost of goods sold → critical strategic role.

## **7. Sourcing Decisions**
### Vertical Integration
Extent to which a firm controls the supply chain.

- **Backward integration:** Own raw materials.
- **Forward integration:** Own distribution channels.

### Make-or-Buy Analysis  

$$
TC_{\text{make}} = FC_{\text{make}} + VC_{\text{make}} Q
$$ 

$$
TC_{\text{buy}} = FC_{\text{buy}} + VC_{\text{buy}} Q
$$

Indifference quantity:  

$$
Q = \frac{FC_{\text{make}} - FC_{\text{buy}}}{VC_{\text{buy}} - VC_{\text{make}}}
$$

# **Chapter 5 – Total Quality Management (TQM)**

## **1. What is TQM?**
A philosophy combining people, processes, and tools to improve customer satisfaction.

Focuses on:
- Customer needs  
- Root cause identification  
- Continuous improvement  
- Quality built into processes  

## **2. Perspectives of Quality**
1. Conformance to specifications  
2. Fitness for use  
3. Value for price paid  
4. Support services  
5. Psychological impressions  

## **3. Manufacturing vs. Service Quality**

## **5. Quality Gurus**
- **Shewhart** – SPC  
- **Deming** – 14 points, PDSA  
- **Juran** – Quality trilogy  
- **Feigenbaum** – Total quality control  
- **Crosby** – Zero defects  
- **Ishikawa** – Cause-and-effect diagram  
- **Taguchi** – Robust design  

## **6. Deming’s 14 Points**

1. **Create constancy of purpose**  
   Focus the organization on long-term improvement rather than short-term financial fixes. Invest in innovation, training, and product/service enhancement with a stable long-term strategic vision.

2. **Adopt the new philosophy**  
   Accept modern quality thinking and reject outdated systems. Everyone must recognize the importance of quality, prevention, and continuous improvement.

3. **Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality**  
   Build quality into the process itself instead of relying on after-the-fact inspection. Prevention is more effective and less costly than detecting errors later.

4. **End the practice of awarding business on price alone**  
   Work with fewer, more reliable suppliers who provide consistent quality. Choose suppliers based on long-term value, not just lowest bid.

5. **Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service**  
   Continuous improvement must be a permanent organizational goal. Reduce waste, variation, and inefficiencies on an ongoing basis.

6. **Institute training on the job**  
   Ensure employees get proper training for their tasks. Skilled workers are essential for stable processes and consistent quality.

7. **Institute leadership**  
   Managers must act as coaches and facilitators. Leadership involves enabling employees to do their best by removing obstacles and improving systems.

8. **Drive out fear**  
   Employees should feel safe reporting problems, giving feedback, and suggesting improvements. Fear leads to hiding defects and poor communication.

9. **Break down barriers between departments**  
   Encourage collaboration across all functions. Silos lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and conflicting goals.

10. **Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce**  
    Motivational posters and goals do not improve quality. Problems are rooted in systems, not workers; focus on fixing processes instead.

11. **Eliminate numerical quotas and management by objective**  
    Quotas force employees to prioritize speed over quality. Replace arbitrary numbers with meaningful measures and process-oriented improvements.

12. **Remove barriers that rob workers of pride of workmanship**  
    Poor equipment, unclear instructions, and inconsistent policies harm worker satisfaction and performance. Provide tools, clarity, and support.

13. **Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement**  
    Encourage continuous personal development. A knowledgeable workforce is more adaptable, innovative, and capable of solving complex problems.

14. **Put everyone in the organization to work for the transformation**  
    Quality is everyone’s responsibility. Improvement requires full organizational commitment from top management to frontline employees.
 

## **7. TQM Core Concepts**
1. Customer focus  
2. Continuous improvement  
3. Employee empowerment  
4. Quality tools  
5. Product design  
6. Process management

## **8. Seven Basic Quality Tools**

1. **Cause-and-Effect Diagram (Fishbone / Ishikawa)**  
   Identifies possible causes of a problem by categorizing them (e.g., Methods, Machines, People, Materials).  
   Helps teams explore root causes rather than symptoms.

2. **Flowchart**  
   Visual map of a process.  
   Shows steps, decisions, and paths, making it easier to spot redundancies, bottlenecks, or non–value-added activities.

3. **Checklist**  
   Simple structured form used to collect data consistently.  
   Ensures that observations or actions are recorded the same way every time, reducing variation in data collection.

4. **Control Chart**  
   Time-based chart showing process performance with upper and lower control limits.  
   Helps determine whether variation is due to common causes (normal) or assignable causes (needs correction).

5. **Scatter Diagram**  
   Plots pairs of data to reveal possible relationships or correlations between two variables (e.g., temperature vs. defects).  
   Useful for identifying patterns or causes of variation.

6. **Pareto Chart**  
   Bar chart that ranks problems or causes by frequency.  
   Based on the 80/20 rule: a small number of causes often account for most of the problems.

7. **Histogram**  
   Bar graph showing the distribution of a dataset.  
   Helps visualize variation, central tendency, and spread to see whether the process behaves normally or has unusual patterns.

## **9. Quality Function Deployment (QFD)**
- Converts customer needs → engineering specifications.
- Uses House of Quality matrices.

## **10. Reliability**
### Series:

$$
R_S = R_1 R_2 \dots R_n
$$

### Parallel:
Improves overall reliability by backing up components.

## **11. Awards & Standards**
- Malcolm Baldrige Award  
- Deming Prize  
- ISO 9000 (quality)  
- ISO 14000 (environment)

# **Chapter 6 – Statistical Quality Control (SQC)**

## **1. Three Categories of SQC**
1. **SPC (Statistical Process Control)**  
2. **Descriptive statistics**  
3. **Acceptance sampling**  

## **2. Causes of Variation**
- **Common causes:** natural variation  
- **Assignable causes:** identifiable sources (correctable)  

## **3. Descriptive Statistics**
- Mean  
- Range  
- Standard deviation  
- Distribution shape  

## **4. Control Charts**
Used to detect whether a process is in control.

### Charts for Variables
- **X-bar chart:** process mean  
- **R chart:** process variability  

### Charts for Attributes
- **p-chart:** proportion defective  
- **c-chart:** number of defects per unit  

## **5. Process Capability**
- **Cp** → assumes centered  
- **Cpk** → accounts for off-centering  
- If Cpk < 1 → **not capable**  

$$
Cp = \frac{USL - LSL}{6\sigma}
$$

Where:  
- $USL$ = Upper Specification Limit  
- $LSL$= Lower Specification Limit  
- $σ$ = Process standard deviation  

A higher Cp means the process has a wider capability relative to its variation.

Measures how well the process is centered *and* how much variation exists.  
It takes into account the distance from the mean to each specification limit.

$$
Cpk = \min\left( \frac{USL - \mu}{3\sigma},\; \frac{\mu - LSL}{3\sigma} \right)
$$

Where:  
- $μ$ = Process mean  
- $USL, LSL, σ$ as above  

Cpk tells you how capable the process is **in reality**, including off-center shifts.


## **6. Six Sigma**
- ±6 standard deviations fit within spec limits  
- 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO)  

## **7. Acceptance Sampling**
Used for lot acceptance.

Key terms:
- AQL  
- LTPD  
- Producer’s risk (α)  
- Consumer’s risk (β)  

OC curves show sampling performance.

## **8. Out-of-Control Signals**
- One point outside UCL/LCL  
- 2 of 3 points beyond 2σ  
- 4 of 5 points beyond 1σ  
- 8 consecutive points on same side of mean  
- Trends/patterns
