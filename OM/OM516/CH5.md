# **Chapter 5 — Total Quality Management (TQM)**  
*Condensed Study Guide*

## **1. What is TQM?**
- Organization-wide philosophy focused on **meeting customer needs**, **identifying root causes**, and **building quality into processes**.
- Integrates technical tools + people practices.
- Applies across all operations, not just manufacturing.

---

## **2. Defining Quality (5 Perspectives)**
1. **Conformance to specifications** – meeting tolerances.  
2. **Fitness for use** – performance for intended purpose.  
3. **Value for price paid** – usefulness relative to cost.  
4. **Support services** – after-sale support quality.  
5. **Psychological** – prestige, ambiance, friendliness.

---

## **3. Manufacturing vs. Service Quality**
### *Manufacturing*
- Tangible features: conformance, performance, reliability, durability, serviceability.

### *Service*
- Intangibles: consistency, responsiveness, courtesy, timeliness, atmosphere.

---

## **4. Cost of Quality (4 Categories)**
### **Quality Control Costs** *(to achieve quality)*  
- **Prevention costs** (training, process design)  
- **Appraisal costs** (inspection, testing)

### **Quality Failure Costs** *(from poor quality)*  
- **Internal failure** (scrap, rework)  
- **External failure** (returns, warranty claims)

---

## **5. Evolution of TQM**
- Shift from end-of-line inspection → process-embedded quality.
- Emphasizes **customer-driven**, **system-wide**, **continuous improvement**.

---

## **6. Key Quality Gurus**
- **Shewhart** – statistical process control.  
- **Deming** – 14 points, PDSA cycle.  
- **Juran** – quality trilogy.  
- **Feigenbaum** – total quality control.  
- **Crosby** – zero defects.  
- **Ishikawa** – cause-and-effect diagrams.  
- **Taguchi** – robust design.

---

## **7. Deming’s 14 Points (Condensed)**
- Continuous improvement, leadership, training.  
- Cease inspection dependence; work with few suppliers.  
- Drive out fear; remove barriers to pride of workmanship.  
- Eliminate quotas, slogans, and arbitrary goals.  
- Educate and improve everyone.  
- Put everyone to work on transformation.

## **8. TQM Philosophy — Seven Core Concepts**
1. **Customer focus**  
2. **Continuous improvement**  
3. **Employee empowerment**  
4. **Quality tools**  
5. **Product design**  
6. **Process management**  
7. **Supplier quality management**

---

## **9. Improving Quality: Key Methods**
### **PDSA Cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Act)**
- Continuous, iterative problem-solving loop.

### **Seven Tools of Quality Control**
1. Cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagram  
2. Flowchart  
3. Checklist  
4. Control chart  
5. Scatter diagram  
6. Pareto analysis (80/20 rule)  
7. Histogram  

---

## **10. Quality Function Deployment (QFD)**
- Translates **customer requirements → technical specifications**.
- Uses the **House of Quality** for:
  - Customer needs  
  - Competitive evaluation  
  - Product characteristics  
  - Relationship & trade-off matrices  
  - Target setting

---

## **11. Reliability (Critical to Quality)**
### **Series System Reliability**
\[
R_S = R_1 \times R_2 \times \dots \times R_n
\]

### **Parallel Components**
- Improves reliability since system works if one component works.

### **Example**
- Part 1: 0.80  
- Part 2: 0.98  
- Series system reliability: 0.784  
- With 80% backup for Part 1 (parallel): reliability increases significantly.

---

## **12. Process Management & Supplier Quality**
- Quality must be built **into the process**.
- “Quality at the source”: identify and correct defects at origin.
- Supplier quality critical to final product quality.

---

## **13. Quality Awards & Standards**
- **Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award** – recognizes excellence.  
- **Deming Prize** – Japanese quality leadership award.  
- **ISO 9000** – international quality management standards.  
- **ISO 14000** – environmental management.

---

## **14. Why TQM Efforts Fail**
- Weak or insincere quality culture.  
- Lack of leadership commitment.  
- Misuse or over/under-reliance on statistical tools.  

---

## **15. TQM Across Functional Areas**
- **Marketing** – voice of the customer.  
- **Finance** – evaluates financial returns on quality.  
- **Accounting** – accurate costing.  
- **Engineering** – converts customer needs into specs.  
- **Purchasing** – ensures supplier quality.  
- **HR** – hires/trains for quality.  
- **Information Systems** – supports data visibility.

---

## **16. Summary Highlights**
- TQM shifts from inspection → prevention + process quality.
- Four quality cost categories: prevention, appraisal, internal, external.
- Seven TQM pillars integrate technical + people systems.
- QFD converts customer needs to engineering specs.
- Reliability = probability of functioning as expected.
- Baldrige and ISO provide quality frameworks and recognition.
