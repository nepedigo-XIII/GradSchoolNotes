# 📚 Operations Management Study Guide

This guide is based on the review-day notes and expands each topic into a more detailed explanation.  
It is organized by chapters and major exam topics.

---

## **Chapter 1 – Introduction to Operations**

### What is Operations?
- Operations refers to the management of processes that are used to transform resources (inputs) into goods and services (outputs).
- Operations apply to both **manufacturing** (tangible goods) and **service organizations** (intangible services).

### What is Operations Management?
- The systematic design, direction, and control of processes that transform inputs into services and products.
- Focuses on **efficiency** (doing things right, minimizing waste) and **effectiveness** (doing the right things, meeting customer needs).

### Input → Process → Output Model
- **Inputs:** Labor, materials, energy, capital, information.
- **Processes:** Activities and operations that add value, such as assembling, serving, transporting, designing, etc.
- **Outputs:** Final goods or services delivered to the customer.

### Services vs. Goods
- **Goods:**
  - Tangible.
  - Can be inventoried for later use.
  - Often capital intensive.
- **Services:**
  - Intangible.
  - Cannot be inventoried (produced and consumed simultaneously).
  - Often labor intensive.

### Strategic vs. Tactical Decisions
- **Strategic decisions:**
  - Long-term, high-level, and often expensive to reverse.
  - Examples: capacity planning, location decisions, process technology.
- **Tactical decisions:**
  - Short-term, routine, and less costly to reverse.
  - Examples: scheduling workers, ordering materials, managing day-to-day operations.

### Optimal vs. Heuristic Decision Making
- **Optimal:** Decisions derived from mathematical models or optimization techniques that guarantee the "best" solution given assumptions.
- **Heuristic:** Rule-of-thumb or experience-based decision making. Provides "good enough" solutions, faster but not always best.

## **Chapter 8 – Forecasting**

### Components of Forecasting
- **Trend:** A long-term upward or downward movement in data over time.
- **Seasonality:** A repeating pattern of demand increases or decreases tied to a calendar (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly).

### Exponential Smoothing
A forecasting method that gives more weight to recent data.

$$
F_{t+1} = \alpha D_t + (1 - \alpha)F_t
$$

Where:  
- \(F_{t+1}\) = forecast for next period  
- \(D_t\) = actual demand in current period  
- \(F_t\) = forecast for current period  
- \(\alpha\) = smoothing constant (0 < α < 1)  

### Forecast Accuracy Measures

**Absolute Deviation (AD):**

$$
AD = |D - F|
$$

**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):**

$$
MAD = \frac{\sum |D - F|}{n}
$$

### Seasonal Index (SI)
Steps to calculate:
1. Compute the average demand for each year.  
2. For each season in that year, divide the actual demand by the yearly average → seasonal ratio.  
3. Repeat for all years.  
4. Average the ratios for each season across years → Seasonal Index (SI).  
5. Forecast = (average demand per season) × SI.  

### Dummy (Binary) Variables in Forecasting
- Used in regression models to represent categorical factors such as "season" or "day of the week."
- If there are \(n\) categories, only \(n-1\) dummy variables are required to avoid perfect multicollinearity.
- Example: For 4 seasons, 3 binary variables would be used.

## **Chapter 12 – Inventory Management**

### Balancing Costs
Inventory management tries to balance **ordering costs** (costs to place an order/setup production) with **holding costs** (costs of storing inventory).

### Deterministic Models
1. **ABC Classification:**
   - Based on the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).
   - A-items: high-value, low-frequency.  
   - B-items: moderate.  
   - C-items: low-value, high-frequency.  

2. **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity):**

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

Where:  
- \(D\) = annual demand  
- \(S\) = ordering/setup cost  
- \(H\) = annual holding cost per unit  

**Least realistic assumption:** Demand is known and constant.  

3. **EPQ (Economic Production Quantity):**

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{P}{P-d}}
$$

Where:  
- \(P\) = production rate  
- \(d\) = demand rate  

4. **Quantity Discounts:**
   - EOQ is calculated for each price bracket.  
   - If EOQ is outside the bracket, adjust to nearest feasible value.  
   - Compute total cost for each option, choose the lowest.  

### Probabilistic Models
1. **Single-Period Model:**
   - For perishable or seasonal products.
   - Goal = maximize expected payoff (balance cost of overage vs. underage).  

2. **Service Level Approach:**
   - Probability of not stocking out.  
   - Higher service level = more safety stock.  

### Safety Stock (SS)

**Demand During Lead Time:**

$$
\text{Demand During Lead Time} = \text{Usage Rate} \times \text{Lead Time}
$$

## **Chapter 13 – Aggregate Planning**

### Goal
Match supply and demand by balancing:
- Capacity (workers, machines),  
- Inventory,  
- Time (backorders or overtime).  

### Key Decisions
- How many workers to hire or fire.  
- How much to produce in each period.  
- How much inventory or backlog to carry.  

### Aggregate Planning Strategies
- **Level Strategy:**
  - Produce at a constant rate regardless of demand.  
  - Absorb fluctuations through inventory and backorders.  
  - Best for **make-to-stock (MTS)** products, such as appliances.  

- **Chase Strategy:**
  - Adjust production to match demand exactly.  
  - Changes in workforce or output levels are common.  
  - Best for **make-to-order (MTO)** products, such as customized furniture.

## **Chapter 14 – Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**

### Characteristics of MRP
- A **push system**: schedules production based on forecasts and internal company planning, not customer demand.  
- More company-centric than customer-centric.  

### Independent vs. Dependent Demand
- **Independent demand:** Demand for final products (e.g., finished car).  
- **Dependent demand:** Demand for components and subassemblies (e.g., tires, engines) driven by the demand for the final product.  

### Order Release vs. Capacity Planning
- **Order release:** When orders for materials are placed.  
- Once released, orders are locked in and cannot be changed.  
- **Capacity planning:** Ensures resources (labor, machines) can meet the scheduled load.  

### BOM Explosion
- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** A structured list of all parts and materials required to make a finished product.  
- **BOM explosion:** Expands each level of the BOM to determine requirements for each component.  
- More complex products have longer lead times due to deeper BOM structures.

## **Formulas and Key Notes**

### EOQ

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

### EPQ

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{P}{P-d}}
$$

### Safety Stock (Basic)

$$
\text{Demand During Lead Time} = \text{Usage Rate} \times \text{Lead Time}
$$

### Forecast Accuracy

$$
MAD = \frac{\sum |D - F|}{n}
$$

### Exponential Smoothing

$$
F_{t+1} = \alpha D_t + (1 - \alpha)F_t
$$
