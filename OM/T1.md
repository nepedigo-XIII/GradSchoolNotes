# ðŸ“š Operations Management Study Guide

This guide is based on the review-day notes and expands each topic into a more detailed explanation.  
It is organized by chapters and major exam topics.

## **Chapter 1 â€“ Introduction to Operations**

### What is Operations?
- Operations refers to the management of processes that are used to transform resources (inputs) into goods and services (outputs).
- Operations apply to both **manufacturing** (tangible goods) and **service organizations** (intangible services).

### What is Operations Management?
- The systematic design, direction, and control of processes that transform inputs into services and products.
- Focuses on **efficiency** (doing things right, minimizing waste) and **effectiveness** (doing the right things, meeting customer needs).

### Input â†’ Process â†’ Output Model
- **Inputs:** Labor, materials, energy, capital, information.
- **Processes:** Activities and operations that add value, such as assembling, serving, transporting, designing, etc.
- **Outputs:** Final goods or services delivered to the customer.

### Services vs. Goods
- **Goods:**
  - Tangible.
  - Can be inventoried for later use.
  - Often capital intensive.
- **Services:**
  - Intangible.
  - Cannot be inventoried (produced and consumed simultaneously).
  - Often labor intensive.

### Strategic vs. Tactical Decisions
- **Strategic decisions:**
  - Long-term, high-level, and often expensive to reverse.
  - Examples: capacity planning, location decisions, process technology.
- **Tactical decisions:**
  - Short-term, routine, and less costly to reverse.
  - Examples: scheduling workers, ordering materials, managing day-to-day operations.

### Optimal vs. Heuristic Decision Making
- **Optimal:** Decisions derived from mathematical models or optimization techniques that guarantee the "best" solution given assumptions.
- **Heuristic:** Rule-of-thumb or experience-based decision making. Provides "good enough" solutions, faster but not always best.

## **Chapter 8 â€“ Forecasting**

### Components of Forecasting
- **Trend:** A long-term upward or downward movement in data over time.
- **Seasonality:** A repeating pattern of demand increases or decreases tied to a calendar (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly).

### Exponential Smoothing
A forecasting method that gives more weight to recent data.

$$
F_{t+1} = \alpha D_t + (1 - \alpha)F_t
$$

Where:  
- $F_{t+1}$ = forecast for next period  
- $D_t$ = actual demand in current period  
- $F_t$ = forecast for current period  
- $\alpha$ = smoothing constant (0 < Î± < 1)  

### Forecast Accuracy Measures

**Absolute Deviation (AD):**

$$
AD = |D - F|
$$

**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):**

$$
MAD = \frac{\sum |D - F|}{n}
$$

### Seasonal Index (SI)
Steps to calculate:
1. Compute the average demand for each year.  
2. For each season in that year, divide the actual demand by the yearly average â†’ seasonal ratio.  
3. Repeat for all years.  
4. Average the ratios for each season across years â†’ Seasonal Index (SI).  
5. Forecast = (average demand per season) Ã— SI.  

### Dummy (Binary) Variables in Forecasting
- Used in regression models to represent categorical factors such as "season" or "day of the week."
- If there are $n$ categories, only $n-1$ dummy variables are required to avoid perfect multicollinearity.
- Example: For 4 seasons, 3 binary variables would be used.

## **Chapter 12 â€“ Inventory Management**

### Balancing Costs
Inventory management tries to balance **ordering costs** (costs to place an order/setup production) with **holding costs** (costs of storing inventory).

### Deterministic Models
1. **ABC Classification:**
   - Based on the Pareto principle (80/20 rule).
   - A-items: high-value, low-frequency.  
   - B-items: moderate.  
   - C-items: low-value, high-frequency.  

2. **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity):**

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

Where:  
- $D$ = annual demand  
- $S$ = ordering/setup cost  
- $H$ = annual holding cost per unit  

**Least realistic assumption:** Demand is known and constant.  

3. **EPQ (Economic Production Quantity):**

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{P}{P-d}}
$$

Where:  
- $P$ = production rate  
- $d$ = demand rate  

4. **Quantity Discounts:**
   - EOQ is calculated for each price bracket.  
   - If EOQ is outside the bracket, adjust to nearest feasible value.  
   - Compute total cost for each option, choose the lowest.  

### Probabilistic Models
1. **Single-Period Model:**
   - For perishable or seasonal products.
   - Goal = maximize expected payoff (balance cost of overage vs. underage).  

2. **Service Level Approach:**
   - Probability of not stocking out.  
   - Higher service level = more safety stock.  

### Safety Stock (SS)

**Demand During Lead Time:**

$$
\text{Demand During Lead Time} = \text{Usage Rate} \times \text{Lead Time}
$$

## **Chapter 13 â€“ Aggregate Planning**

### Goal
Match supply and demand by balancing:
- Capacity (workers, machines),  
- Inventory,  
- Time (backorders or overtime).  

### Key Decisions
- How many workers to hire or fire.  
- How much to produce in each period.  
- How much inventory or backlog to carry.  

### Aggregate Planning Strategies
- **Level Strategy:**
  - Produce at a constant rate regardless of demand.  
  - Absorb fluctuations through inventory and backorders.  
  - Best for **make-to-stock (MTS)** products, such as appliances.  

- **Chase Strategy:**
  - Adjust production to match demand exactly.  
  - Changes in workforce or output levels are common.  
  - Best for **make-to-order (MTO)** products, such as customized furniture.

## **Chapter 14 â€“ Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**

### Characteristics of MRP
- A **push system**: schedules production based on forecasts and internal company planning, not customer demand.  
- More company-centric than customer-centric.  

### Independent vs. Dependent Demand
- **Independent demand:** Demand for final products (e.g., finished car).  
- **Dependent demand:** Demand for components and subassemblies (e.g., tires, engines) driven by the demand for the final product.  

### Order Release vs. Capacity Planning
- **Order release:** When orders for materials are placed.  
- Once released, orders are locked in and cannot be changed.  
- **Capacity planning:** Ensures resources (labor, machines) can meet the scheduled load.  

### BOM Explosion
- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** A structured list of all parts and materials required to make a finished product.  
- **BOM explosion:** Expands each level of the BOM to determine requirements for each component.  
- More complex products have longer lead times due to deeper BOM structures.

## **Formulas and Key Notes**

### EOQ

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

### EPQ

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{P}{P-d}}
$$

### Safety Stock (Basic)

$$
\text{Demand During Lead Time} = \text{Usage Rate} \times \text{Lead Time}
$$

### Forecast Accuracy

$$
MAD = \frac{\sum |D - F|}{n}
$$

### Exponential Smoothing

$$
F_{t+1} = \alpha D_t + (1 - \alpha)F_t
$$
