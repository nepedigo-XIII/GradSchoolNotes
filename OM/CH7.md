# **Chapter 7 — Just-in-Time (JIT) & Lean Systems**  
*Condensed Study Guide*

## **1. Core Ideas of JIT**
- “Right quantity, right place, right time.”
- Focuses on eliminating **waste** (anything not adding value).
- Broader than inventory reduction → entire organization aligned around customer value.
- Originated at **Toyota** post-WWII; global adoption in 1970s–80s.
- Also known as **Lean Production / Lean Systems**.

---

## **2. Lean Philosophy**
- Lean = waste elimination + value focus.
- Hopp & Spearman: lean systems minimize buffering in:
  - **Capacity**
  - **Time**
  - **Inventory**

---

## **3. Core Beliefs of JIT**
- Broad organizational view focused on serving the customer.
- **Simplicity**: simpler systems are more reliable.
- **Continuous improvement (Kaizen)**.
- **Visibility**: waste must be visible to eliminate it.
- **Flexibility**: adapt quickly to changing environments.

## **4. Three Elements of JIT**
1. **JIT Manufacturing** – value-added production system.  
2. **TQM (Total Quality Management)** – quality embedded at every level.  
3. **Respect for People** – employees as essential contributors.

---

## **5. Key Elements of JIT Manufacturing**
- **Kanban** pull production.
- **Small lot sizes** and **quick setup times**.
- **Uniform plant loading** (level scheduling).
- **Flexible resources** (multifunction workers, general-purpose equipment).
- **Efficient layouts** (cellular manufacturing, U-shaped lines).
- **Inventory reduction**.

---

## **6. Pull vs Push Systems**
- **Push**: produce based on forecasts.  
- **Pull**: final workstation signals exact needs; eliminates overproduction.

---

## **7. Kanban Calculation**
**Formula:**  
N = (D × T × (1 + S)) / C  
Where:  
- N = # of containers  
- D = demand rate  
- T = lead time  
- C = container size  
- S = safety stock factor  

---

## **8. Small Lots & Quick Setups**
- Small lots → lower inventory, shorter lead times, greater responsiveness.
- Goal: **single-digit setup times** (<10 minutes).
- **External setup**: done while machine still runs.  
- **Internal setup**: requires machine stoppage.  
- Ultimate goal: **one-unit flow**.

---

## **9. Uniform Plant Loading**
- Smooth, level production schedule.
- Reduces variability and stabilizes the supply chain.

---

## **10. Flexible Resources**
- Portable, multi-use equipment.
- Workers trained in multiple tasks; responsible for problem solving.

---

## **11. Facility Layout**
- Close workstation proximity → reduced movement.
- **Cellular manufacturing** for product families.
- **U-shaped lines** improve visibility and workflow.

---

## **12. TQM in JIT**
- Quality is built into the **process**, not inspected afterward.
- **Quality at the source**, **sequential inspection**.
- **Jidoka**: authority to stop the line.
- **Poka-yoke**: mistake-proofing systems.
- **Preventive maintenance** ensures equipment reliability.

---

## **13. Respect for People**
### **Employees**
- Multi-skilled; empowered decision-makers.
- Participate in quality circles.
- Responsible for quality and preventive maintenance.

### **Management**
- Builds trust-based culture.
- Coaches and develops workers.
- Promotes teamwork and cross-training.
- Develops collaborative supplier relationships:
  - Single-source
  - Long-term partnerships
  - Shared information and process certification

---

## **14. Benefits of JIT**
- Lower inventory  
- Improved quality  
- Reduced space and lead times  
- Lower costs  
- Higher productivity and machine utilization  
- Greater flexibility  

---

## **15. Implementing JIT**
Success requires:
- Clear shared vision.
- Strong leadership + a “Champion.”

**7 Implementation Steps:**  
1. Improve quality  
2. Reorganize workplace  
3. Reduce setup times  
4. Reduce lot sizes & lead times  
5. Implement layout changes  
6. Switch to pull production  
7. Develop supplier relationships  

*(Inventory reduction is a **result**, not a step.)*

---

## **16. JIT in Services**
- Applies to timeliness, consistency, courtesy.
- Uses multifunction workers, reduced cycle time, and organized workplaces.
- Facility loading helps respond to demand smoothly.

---

## **17. JIT Across the Organization**
- Eliminates functional barriers.
- Accounting shifts to activity-based costing.
- Marketing interfaces closely with customers.
- Finance assesses JIT-related investments.
- Information systems provide real-time data flows.

---

## **18. Summary Highlights**
- JIT = philosophy focused on **simplicity**, **waste elimination**, **visibility**, and **flexibility**.
- Three pillars: **JIT manufacturing**, **TQM**, **respect for people**.
- Pull systems and Kanban drive synchronized production.
- TQM & continuous improvement ensure quality at the source.
- People remain the most important JIT resource.
- JIT applies to manufacturing **and** services.
