# Chapter 13 – Aggregate Planning (Study Guide)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain business planning.
- Discuss planning options.
- Identify aggregate planning strategies.
- Develop aggregate plans using cost and qualitative factors.
- Evaluate and synthesize aggregate planning strategies.

---

## Business Planning
**Strategic Business Plan**  
- Long-range strategy with revenue, cost, and profit objectives.

**Supporting Plans**  
- Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP)  
- Marketing Plan  
- Production Plan  
- Financial Plan  
- Engineering Plan  
- Master Production Schedule (MPS)

---

## Aggregate Planning
- Medium-term (6–18 months) plan for operations.  
- Supports the strategic plan.  
- Also called the **Production Plan**.  
- Specifies:  
  - Aggregate production rate  
  - Workforce size  
  - Resource requirements  
- Outputs measured in units, gallons, pounds, standard hours, or dollars.

## Aggregate Planning Options

### Demand-Based Options
- **Reactive**  
  - Use **inventory** to absorb fluctuations.  
  - Use **backorders** (delayed fulfillment, costly).  

- **Proactive**  
  - Shift demand using **incentives or promotions**.  
  - Example: early bird pricing at restaurants.

### Capacity-Based Options
- **Overtime**: Higher unit labor cost; short-term only.  
- **Undertime**: Lower utilization; short-term only.  
- **Subcontracting**: Extra capacity; medium–long term.  
- **Hiring & Firing**: Costly; long-term.  
- **Part-Timers**: Flexible, but with operational trade-offs.

## Aggregate Plan Strategies

### 1. Level Strategy
- Maintain a **constant workforce**.  
- Capacity set to meet **average demand**.  
- Often used for **make-to-stock products**.  
- Downsides: inventory buildup and/or backorders.  
- Relies on **demand-based options**.

### 2. Chase Strategy
- Match **output exactly to demand** each period.  
- Adjust capacity (labor/equipment) continuously.  
- Suited for **make-to-order products**.  
- Downsides: frequent hiring/firing or overtime changes.  
- Relies on **capacity-based options**.

### 3. Hybrid Strategy
- Mix of level and chase.  
- Limited set of options for feasibility.  
- Examples:  
  - Constant workforce + overtime/temps.  
  - Some inventory buildup with limited backorders.  
  - Short-term subcontracting.

## Developing an Aggregate Plan
1. **Choose strategy**: level, chase, or hybrid.  
2. **Determine aggregate production rate**.  
3. **Calculate workforce size**.  
4. **Test plan**:  
   - Inventory, hiring/firing, overtime.  
   - Total cost.  
5. **Evaluate performance**: cost, service, HR, operations.

---

## Aggregate Plans: Tangible vs. Intangible Products
**With Tangible Products**  
- Options: inventory, backorders, hiring/firing, overtime.  

**Without Tangible Products (Services)**  
- No inventory possible.  
- Must meet demand directly (or lose business).  
- Options: overtime, undertime, hiring/firing.

---

## Role Within Operations Management
- Links forecasts (Ch. 8) to production plans.  
- Determines workforce size, capacity, and schedules.  
- Guides equipment, layout (Ch. 10), and staffing (Ch. 15).  
- Provides operational resources to achieve strategy.

---

## Organizational Impact
- **Accounting**: cost/resource implications.  
- **Marketing**: supported by production capabilities.  
- **Information Systems**: maintain forecasts and data.  
- **Purchasing**: aligns material sourcing with production.  
- **Manufacturing**: determines workforce & inventory.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Level Strategy**: constant workforce, inventories/backorders absorb demand swings.  
- **Chase Strategy**: workforce/capacity adjusted each period to match demand.  
- **Hybrid Strategy**: blend of both.  
- Services cannot use inventory as a buffer.  
- Demand can be smoothed with **pricing incentives**.  
- Aggregate planning is difficult under uncertainty; firms rely on policies and strategies.
