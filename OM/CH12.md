## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:  
- Discuss **basic inventory principles**.  
- Explain the **relevant inventory costs**.  
- Apply the **ABC inventory classification model**.  
- Calculate **order quantities** using various models.  
- Determine the appropriate **safety stock levels**.

## Types of Inventory  
Inventory serves different purposes in organizations, and each type is used to address specific needs:  

- **Anticipation or Seasonal Inventory**  
  - Built up in advance of expected future demand (e.g., holiday season stock).  

- **Fluctuation Inventory / Safety Stock (Reserve Stock)**  
  - A buffer against uncertain demand fluctuations.  

- **Lot-Size or Cycle Stock**  
  - Arises from purchasing or producing in larger batches to take advantage of **quantity discounts** or **efficiency gains**.  

- **Transportation or Pipeline Inventory**  
  - Items currently in transit between locations.  

- **Speculative or Hedge Inventory**  
  - Protects against **future risks** such as strikes, raw material price increases, or shortages.  

- **Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO) Inventory**  
  - Supplies necessary for operations but not part of the final product (e.g., lubricants, tools, office supplies).  

---

## Objectives of Inventory Management  
Inventory management balances several competing goals:  

1. **Customer Service** – Ensuring that demand is met without stockouts.  
2. **Cost-Efficient Operations** – Minimizing the operational cost structure while supporting production.  
3. **Minimum Inventory Investment** – Reducing capital tied up in unused stock.  

---

## Key Inventory Performance Measures  

- **Inventory Turnover**  
  - Measures how many times inventory is sold or used in a given time period.  

- **Weeks (or Days, Hours) of Supply**  
  - Indicates how long the current inventory will last at the present usage rate.  

---

## Relevant Inventory Costs  

### Item Cost  
- Includes the **purchase price** of an item and any additional direct costs tied to acquisition.  

### Holding Costs (Carrying Costs)  
- Variable costs incurred from holding inventory, often **15–25% of item value annually**.  
- Examples: storage, insurance, depreciation.  

### Capital Costs  
- Higher of the company’s **cost of capital** or its **opportunity cost**.  

### Ordering Costs  
- Fixed dollar amount for each order placed, regardless of size.  

### Shortage Costs  
- Costs from stockouts: lost sales, backorder processing, and decreased goodwill.  

### Risk Costs  
- Costs tied to inventory risk: obsolescence, damage, theft, and taxes.  

### Storage Costs  
- Expenses for facilities, labor, and equipment needed to store inventory.  

---

## ABC Inventory Classification  
The **ABC model** applies **Pareto’s 80/20 rule**:  
- A small percentage of items account for the majority of inventory value.  

**Steps in ABC Analysis:**  
1. Calculate annual dollar usage:  

   $$ 
   \text{Annual Dollar Usage} = \text{Annual Demand} \times \text{Unit Cost} 
   $$  
   
2. Sort items by descending annual usage.  
3. Compute cumulative percentage of total inventory value.  
4. Classify into groups:  
   - **A items**: High-value, low-volume (tightest control).  
   - **B items**: Moderate-value, moderate-volume.  
   - **C items**: Low-value, high-volume (least control).  

---

## Determining Order Quantities  

### Common Ordering Systems  
- **Lot-for-Lot (L4L)** – Order exactly what is needed.  
- **Fixed Order Quantity** – Always order the same predetermined amount.  
- **Min-Max System** – When inventory hits the minimum, reorder up to the maximum.  
- **Order n Periods** – Order enough to cover the next *n* periods.  

---

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model  

The EOQ model seeks to minimize the **total annual inventory cost**, which is the sum of **ordering costs** and **holding costs**.  

### Assumptions:  
- Demand and lead time are **known and constant**.  
- No quantity discounts.  
- All demand is satisfied (no shortages).  
- Orders arrive in a single batch.  

### EOQ Formula:  

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$  

Where:  
- $D$  = Annual demand (units)  
- $S$ = Ordering cost per order  
- $H$ = Annual holding cost per unit  

### Total Annual Cost:  

$$
TC = \frac{Q}{2}H + \frac{D}{Q}S + DC
$$  

Where:  
- $\frac{Q}{2}H$ = Holding cost  
- $\frac{D}{Q}S$ = Ordering cost  
- $DC$ = Purchase cost (may be ignored if constant)  

### Reorder Point (ROP):  
$$
ROP = dL
$$  

Where:  
- $d$ = Demand rate per unit of time  
- $L$ = Lead time  

---

## Economic Production Quantity (EPQ)  

A modification of EOQ for cases where items are produced and inventory builds up **gradually**.  

### Formula:  
$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{P}{P - d}}
$$  

Where:  
- $P$ = Production rate per unit of time  
- $d$ = Demand rate  

---

## Quantity Discount Model  
When purchase price varies with order size, the EOQ model is adjusted.  

### Total Cost with Discounts:  
$$
TC = \frac{Q}{2}H + \frac{D}{Q}S + DC
$$  

Procedure:  
1. Compute EOQ at each price level.  
2. If EOQ falls within that level’s range, it is feasible.  
3. Compare total costs across brackets.  
4. Select the order quantity with the **lowest total cost**.

## Single Period Inventory (SPI) Model  

For products with a **limited selling season** (e.g., newspapers, perishable goods).  

- Demand is uncertain but follows a probability distribution.  
- Salvage value is **less than purchase cost**.  

### Objective:  
Balance:  
- **Cost of understocking** (lost sales & profit)  
- **Cost of overstocking** (leftover, salvage losses)  

---

## Safety Stock and Service Levels  

If demand or lead time is uncertain, add **safety stock (SS)**:  

### Formula:  
$$
R = dL + SS
$$  

Where:  
- $R$ = Reorder point  
- $dL$ = Expected demand during lead time  
- $SS = z \cdot \sigma_{dL}$ 

Here:  
- $z$ = Standard normal deviate for desired service level  
- $\sigma_{dL}$ = Standard deviation of demand during lead time  

**Example:**  
For a 95% service level:  
$$
z = 1.645
$$

## Inventory Across the Organization  

- **Accounting**: Concerned with valuation and cost reporting.  
- **Marketing**: Focuses on customer service levels.  
- **Information Systems**: Tracks, records, and controls inventory.  
- **Purchasing**: Balances workload and supplier coordination.  
- **Manufacturing**: Prioritizes cost efficiency and smooth operations.  

---

## Chapter Highlights  

- Inventory types: raw materials, components, WIP, finished goods, distribution inventory, MRO.  
- Objectives: customer service, cost efficiency, minimum investment.  
- Costs: item, holding, ordering, shortage, risk, storage.  
- Models: EOQ, EPQ, quantity discount, SPI, safety stock.  
- ABC analysis helps prioritize controls.  
- Reducing setup/ordering cost reduces EOQ and cycle inventory.  
- Smaller lot sizes increase flexibility and responsiveness.
