*Based on Operations Management by R. Dan Reid & Nada R. Sanders*  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:  
- Discuss **basic inventory principles**.  
- Explain the **relevant inventory costs**.  
- Apply the **ABC inventory classification model**.  
- Calculate **order quantities** using various models.  
- Determine the appropriate **safety stock levels**.  

---

## Types of Inventory  
Inventory serves different purposes in organizations, and each type is used to address specific needs:  

- **Anticipation or Seasonal Inventory**  
  - Built up in advance of expected future demand (e.g., holiday season stock).  

- **Fluctuation Inventory / Safety Stock (Reserve Stock)**  
  - A buffer against uncertain demand fluctuations.  

- **Lot-Size or Cycle Stock**  
  - Arises from purchasing or producing in larger batches to take advantage of **quantity discounts** or **efficiency gains**.  

- **Transportation or Pipeline Inventory**  
  - Items currently in transit between locations.  

- **Speculative or Hedge Inventory**  
  - Protects against **future risks** such as strikes, raw material price increases, or shortages.  

- **Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO) Inventory**  
  - Supplies necessary for operations but not part of the final product (e.g., lubricants, tools, office supplies).  

---

## Objectives of Inventory Management  
Inventory management balances several competing goals:  

1. **Customer Service** – Ensuring that demand is met without stockouts.  
2. **Cost-Efficient Operations** – Minimizing the operational cost structure while supporting production.  
3. **Minimum Inventory Investment** – Reducing capital tied up in unused stock.  

---

## Key Inventory Performance Measures  

- **Inventory Turnover**  
  - Measures how many times inventory is sold or used in a given time period.  

- **Weeks (or Days, Hours) of Supply**  
  - Indicates how long the current inventory will last at the present usage rate.  

---

## Relevant Inventory Costs  

### Item Cost  
- Includes the **purchase price** of an item and any additional direct costs tied to acquisition.  

### Holding Costs (Carrying Costs)  
- Variable costs incurred from holding inventory, often **15–25% of item value annually**.  
- Examples: storage, insurance, depreciation.  

### Capital Costs  
- Higher of the company’s **cost of capital** or its **opportunity cost**.  

### Ordering Costs  
- Fixed dollar amount for each order placed, regardless of size.  

### Shortage Costs  
- Costs from stockouts: lost sales, backorder processing, and decreased goodwill.  

### Risk Costs  
- Costs tied to inventory risk: obsolescence, damage, theft, and taxes.  

### Storage Costs  
- Expenses for facilities, labor, and equipment needed to store inventory.  

---

## ABC Inventory Classification  
The **ABC model** applies **Pareto’s 80/20 rule**:  
- A small percentage of items account for the majority of inventory value.  

**Steps in ABC Analysis:**  
1. Calculate annual dollar usage:  

   $$ 
   \text{Annual Dollar Usage} = \text{Annual Demand} \times \text{Unit Cost} 
   $$  
   
2. Sort items by descending annual usage.  
3. Compute cumulative percentage of total inventory value.  
4. Classify into groups:  
   - **A items**: High-value, low-volume (tightest control).  
   - **B items**: Moderate-value, moderate-volume.  
   - **C items**: Low-value, high-volume (least control).  

---

## Determining Order Quantities  

### Common Ordering Systems  
- **Lot-for-Lot (L4L)** – Order exactly what is needed.  
- **Fixed Order Quantity** – Always order the same predetermined amount.  
- **Min-Max System** – When inventory hits the minimum, reorder up to the maximum.  
- **Order n Periods** – Order enough to cover the next *n* periods.  

---

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model  

The EOQ model seeks to minimize the **total annual inventory cost**, which is the sum of **ordering costs** and **holding costs**.  

### Assumptions:  
- Demand and lead time are **known and constant**.  
- No quantity discounts.  
- All demand is satisfied (no shortages).  
- Orders arrive in a single batch.  

### EOQ Formula:  

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$  

Where:  
- $D$  = Annual demand (units)  
- $S$ = Ordering cost per order  
- $H$ = Annual holding cost per unit  

### Total Annual Cost:  

$$
TC = \frac{Q}{2}H + \frac{D}{Q}S + DC
$$  

Where:  
- $\frac{Q}{2}H$ = Holding cost  
- $\frac{D}{Q}S$ = Ordering cost  
- $DC$ = Purchase cost (may be ignored if constant)  

### Reorder Point (ROP):  
$$
ROP = dL
$$  

Where:  
- $d$ = Demand rate per unit of time  
- $L$ = Lead time  


## Inventory Management Objectives

- **Maximize Customer Service**
  - Ensure that the right products are available at the right time in the right quantity.  
  - Reduces stockouts and backorders, leading to higher customer satisfaction.  
  - Achieved by maintaining appropriate stock levels and aligning with demand forecasts.  

- **Minimize Inventory Costs**
  - Inventory ties up capital and incurs multiple costs.  
  - The objective is to balance service levels against the cost of carrying excess stock.  
  - Involves optimizing reorder points, lot sizes, and lead times.  

- **Maximize Efficiency**
  - Efficient use of resources in procurement, storage, and distribution.  
  - Streamlines operations through technology, automation, and proper layout of warehouses.  
  - Reduces waste, improves cash flow, and ensures smooth production processes.

## Cost Types

- **Holding Costs (Carrying Costs)**  
  - Costs of storing inventory over time.  
  - Includes warehousing, insurance, depreciation, obsolescence, and opportunity cost of capital.  
  - Often expressed as a percentage of inventory value per year.  

- **Ordering Costs**  
  - Costs associated with placing and receiving inventory orders.  
  - Includes administrative expenses (paperwork, purchase order processing), shipping, and setup costs for production.  
  - Larger order quantities reduce ordering frequency, but increase holding costs.  

- **Shortage Costs (Stockout Costs)**  
  - Costs incurred when demand cannot be met from available inventory.  
  - Includes lost sales, backorder processing, expedited shipping, and potential loss of customer goodwill.  

- **Risk Costs**  
  - Risks tied to holding inventory, such as damage, theft, spoilage, and obsolescence (especially in technology or fashion industries).  
  - Can also include risks due to supplier disruptions or inaccurate demand forecasting.  

- **Storage Costs**  
  - Direct costs of physically holding inventory in a warehouse.  
  - Includes rent, utilities, equipment, security, and labor required for inventory handling.  
  - Sometimes grouped under holding costs, but often listed separately for clarity.

## ABC Analysis Steps

ABC analysis is a method of classifying inventory into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their relative importance, often measured by annual dollar usage.  

1. **Calculate Annual Dollar Usage for each Item**  
   - Formula:  

     $$
     \text{Annual Dollar Usage} = \text{Annual Demand (units)} \times \text{Unit Cost}
     $$ 

   - Identifies which items contribute most to total inventory value.  

2. **List Items in Descending Order based on Annual Dollar Usage**  
   - Rank all inventory items from highest to lowest total dollar usage.  
   - Highlights the items that consume the majority of investment.  

3. **Calculate the Cumulative Dollar Usage and Percentage**  
   - Compute the cumulative sum of dollar usage as you move down the list.  
   - Divide by total dollar usage to find cumulative percentages.  

4. **Classify Items into Categories (A, B, C)**  
   - **Category A**: High-value items (top ~70–80% of total dollar usage, usually 10–20% of items). Require tight control, accurate records, frequent review.  
   - **Category B**: Moderate-value items (next ~15–25% of total dollar usage, about 30% of items). Controlled with standard review policies.  
   - **Category C**: Low-value items (last ~5–10% of dollar usage, often 50%+ of items). Require simpler, less costly controls.

## Ordering Types

### Lot-for-Lot (L4L)
- **Definition**: Order exactly the amount needed for production or demand in each period, no more and no less.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimizes inventory holding costs (no excess stock carried).  
  - Simple to understand and implement.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High ordering costs due to frequent orders.  
  - Less favorable if order setup costs are significant.  
- **Best Use**: Items with highly variable demand, short shelf life, or when holding costs are high.  



### Fixed Order Quantity (FOQ)
- **Definition**: A predetermined order quantity is used every time inventory is replenished. Often calculated using formulas like EOQ (Economic Order Quantity).  
- **Advantages**:
  - Balances holding and ordering costs.  
  - Can take advantage of bulk discounts.  
  - Provides predictability in ordering and production schedules.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires accurate demand forecasts.  
  - Can result in overstocking or shortages if demand fluctuates significantly.  
- **Best Use**: Stable demand environments where economies of scale in ordering are beneficial.  


### Min-Max System
- **Definition**: Inventory is monitored between a **minimum level (reorder point)** and a **maximum level (target stock)**. When inventory falls below the minimum, an order is placed to bring stock up to the maximum.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Helps maintain safety stock while preventing overstock.  
  - Simple and flexible system, commonly used in retail.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires continuous monitoring or regular checks.  
  - If lead times vary, risk of stockouts increases.  
- **Best Use**: Items with moderately stable demand but where some fluctuation is expected.  



### Order n Periods (Fixed Period Ordering)
- **Definition**: Inventory is replenished to cover demand for a fixed number of future periods (n). For example, if n = 3, orders cover expected demand for the next 3 periods.  
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces the number of orders compared to Lot-for-Lot.  
  - Provides a balance between ordering frequency and holding costs.  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires accurate forecasting of demand over the chosen period.  
  - May lead to excess inventory if demand falls unexpectedly.  
- **Best Use**: Environments with relatively predictable demand and stable lead times.

## EOQ and EPQ


### Assumptions
- Demand is known and constant
- Lead time is known and constant
- no quantity discounts are avialble
- ordering setup costs are constant
- All demand is stasified
- Order quantity arrives in singular shipment

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

- **Basic EOQ Formula**

$$
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

Where:  
- \(D\) = Annual demand (units)  
- \(S\) = Ordering cost per order (setup cost)  
- \(H\) = Holding (carrying) cost per unit per year  

---

- **Total Cost (TC) in EOQ Model**

$$
TC = \frac{D}{Q}S + \frac{Q}{2}H + DC
$$

Where:  
- \(Q\) = Order quantity  
- \(DC\) = Purchase cost (if unit cost is \(C\))  
- First term = ordering cost per year  
- Second term = holding cost per year  

---

- **Reorder Point (ROP)**

$$
ROP = d \times L
$$

Where:  
- \(d\) = Demand rate (units per period)  
- \(L\) = Lead time (periods)  

---

## Economic Production Quantity (EPQ)

- **Basic EPQ Formula**

$$
EPQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H} \cdot \frac{p}{p - d}}
$$

Where:  
- \(D\) = Annual demand (units)  
- \(S\) = Setup cost per production run  
- \(H\) = Holding cost per unit per year  
- \(p\) = Production rate (units per year)  
- \(d\) = Demand rate (units per month)
- \(w\) = Days Operational / month
- \(L\) = Lead Time in days

---

- **Maximum Inventory Level in EPQ**

$$
I_{\max} = Q \left( 1 - \frac{d}{P} \right)
$$

Where:  
- \(Q\) = Production lot size (units)  

---

- **Average Inventory in EPQ**

$$
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{I_{\max}}{2}
$$

---

- **Total Cost (TC) in EPQ Model**

$$
TC = \frac{D}{Q}S + \frac{I_{\text{avg}}}{1}H + DC
$$

Which expands to:

$$
TC = \frac{D}{Q}S + \frac{Q}{2}\left(1 - \frac{d}{P}\right)H + DC
$$

---

## Quantity Discount Model  
When purchase price varies with order size, the EOQ model is adjusted.  

### Total Cost with Discounts:  

$$
TC = \frac{Q}{2}H + \frac{D}{Q}S + DC
$$  

Procedure:  
1. Compute EOQ at each price level.  
2. If EOQ falls within that level’s range, it is feasible.  
3. Compare total costs across brackets.  
4. Select the order quantity with the **lowest total cost**.  

---

## Single Period Inventory (SPI) Model  

For products with a **limited selling season** (e.g., newspapers, perishable goods).  

- Demand is uncertain but follows a probability distribution.  
- Salvage value is **less than purchase cost**.  

### Objective:  
Balance:  
- **Cost of understocking** (lost sales & profit)  
- **Cost of overstocking** (leftover, salvage losses)  

---

## Safety Stock and Service Levels  

If demand or lead time is uncertain, add **safety stock (SS)**:  

### Formula:  
$$
R = dL + SS
$$  

Where:  
- $R$ = Reorder point  
- $dL$ = Expected demand during lead time  
- $SS = z \cdot \sigma_{dL}$ 

Here:  
- $z$ = Standard normal deviate for desired service level  
- $\sigma_{dL}$ = Standard deviation of demand during lead time  

**Example:**  
For a 95% service level:  
$$
z = 1.645
$$  

---

## Inventory Across the Organization  

- **Accounting**: Concerned with valuation and cost reporting.  
- **Marketing**: Focuses on customer service levels.  
- **Information Systems**: Tracks, records, and controls inventory.  
- **Purchasing**: Balances workload and supplier coordination.  
- **Manufacturing**: Prioritizes cost efficiency and smooth operations.
